Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
You do you remember me?
Like I remember you
Do you spend your life going back in your mind to that time?
'Cause I I walk the streets alone
I hate being on my own
And everyone can see that I really fell
And I'm going through hell
Thinking about you with somebody else
Somebody wants you somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that one day you will see
That somebody's me
How how did we go wrong?
It was so good and now it's gone
And I pray at night that our passing will cross
What we hide isn't lost
'Cause you are always right here in my thoughts
Somebody wants you somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that some day you will see
That somebody's me
You will always be in my life even if I'm not in your life
'Cause you're in my memory
You will you remember me?
And before you set me free oh listen please
Somebody wants you somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that some day you will see
That somebody's me
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called  Yellow 
So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know you know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know
For you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry
It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do
Hey I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No I can't stop
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson okay
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet 
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling just kiss me slow your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine
Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass we're listenin' to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it darling you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love to carry children of our own
We are still kids but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand
Be my girl I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass listenin' to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this darling you look perfect tonight
Oh no no
Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass we're listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
No I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
Oh her eyes her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah I know I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me  Do I look okay? 
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
Her lips her lips I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Oh you know you know you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay you know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

Love me tender love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will
Always will
It's a little bit funny this feelin' inside 
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did 
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor but then again no 
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show 
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do 
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss 
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross 
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song 
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgettin' but these things I do 
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue 
Anyway the thing is what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
Some day when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Look I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed after all of these decisions
All these miles feets inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign I'm starting to lose faith
Now tell me how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Look I been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe
Now tell me how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets but I'm all alone
Take me home
Someone take me home
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
You're lovely with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight
With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
Lovely never ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
You're lovely don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
Close your eyes
Let me tell you the reasons why
Think you're one of a kind
Here's to you
The one that I suppose is true
Do what you got to do
You're one of a kind
Thank god your mine
You're an angel dressed in armor
You're the fair in every fight
You're my life and my safe harbor
Where the sun sets every night
And if my love is blind
I don't want to see the light
It's your beauty that betrays you
Your smile gives you away
'Cause you're made of strength and mercy
And my soul is yours to save
And when this much is true
When my world was dark and blue
I know the only one who rescued me was you
Close your eyes
Let me tell you all the reasons why
You're never going to have to cry
Because you're one of a kind
Yeah here's to you
The one that always pulls us through
You always do what you got to do babe
Because you're one of a kind
When your luck was down in me
I know I'm finally free
So I tell you gratefully
Yes you'll be in my heart
Is yours to keep
Close your eyes
Let me tell you all the reasons why
You're never going to have to cry
Because you're one of a kind
Yeah here's to you

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend 
why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead yeah Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep) Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all it all it all
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat  Hello it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing Hello can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet 
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh anymore
Oh anymore
Oh anymore
Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left Look don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to? Look don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say they were never true never true
And the games you'd play you would always win always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name When laying with you
I could stay there close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say they were never true never true
And the games you'd play you would always win always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die 'cause I knew that
That was the last time the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time the last time oh
Oh oh Let it burn oh
Let it burn
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care? It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God this reminds me
Of when we were young When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more Oh I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me Why don't you remember don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again? She she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure she's got it all
But baby is that really what you want Bless your soul you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And boy she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And boy you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt yet I'm cold to the core
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it Rumor has it ooh
Rumor has it ooh

But rumor has it he's the one I'm leaving you for You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your your one and only
I promise I'm worthy mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect

To prove that I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts If you're not the one for me
Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh when you found that the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge Say it ain't so say it ain't so

Say that our love ain't water under the bridge I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
 Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call? 
 No and thank you please Madam 
I ain't lost just wandering  Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world yeah
Of my world
Of my world yeah Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No I won't ask you you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables to turning tables Under haunted skies I see
Where love is lost your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try no I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me no
I won't ask you you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables Next time I'll be braver I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls to me
Next time I'll be braver I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me no
I won't ask you you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables to turning tables
Turning tables yeah turning This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away I'm stolen Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air I miss my friends
I miss my mother I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air I miss my friends
I miss my mother I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr  Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr  Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh ooh
Baby baby
Ooh ooh
Baby baby
Ooh ooh
Baby baby
Ooh In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss I miss I miss I miss my baby
Ooh I I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
everything changed me We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I wanna teach you things you never knew baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Down down down down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Don't let go baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Don't let go baby give me light I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
In your heart I bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Down down down down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Don't let go baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Don't let go baby give me light We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
Harder baby (harder baby) harder baby I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Don't let go baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Don't let go baby give me light I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be I will be your remedy No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be I will be your remedy oh When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be I will be I will be
Your remedy oh Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best
Gave you everything I had everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
But go on and take it take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love take it all with my love Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it you're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this But go on go on take it take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love take it all with my love I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home I will adjust
Oh if only if only you knew
Everything I do is for you But go on and take it take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just want to make love to you

I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest me and you But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried

I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better for you This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away I'm stolen Let the sky fall when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall
at sky fall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall when it crumbles
We will stand tall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me with out the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand     Let the sky fall when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall (Verse 1)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Chorus 1
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling we could've had it all    (You're gonna wish you never met me)
Rolling in the deep    (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared (Chorus 2)
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling we could've had it all
Rolling in the deep    you had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all    Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating (Verse 3)
Throw your stone through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3)
We could've had it all    We could've had it all   
It all It all It all    We could've had it all   
Rollin' in the deep   
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all
Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it you played it to the beat Some say I'll be better without you
They don't know you like I do
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind 
Wake me up wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity is become undone But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go I can't do it on my own
If this is ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk So petrified I'm so scared to step into this right
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk There will be times we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams no doubt
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
But nothing will never taint us I won't go I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk Will he will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath to sit and wait
I'll be home soon I won't be late He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go I can't do it on his own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true never true
And the games you play
You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true never true
And the games you play
You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running with you honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember that come whatever I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope you're my despair
You're my scope everything everywhere The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
When did it go wrong I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go
Why were you so cold let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go 
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go 
Hope you know I won't let go I thought I told you he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself you're too good to be true 
I fall short each time
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire I fall with my pride and all 
Like a bomb before explosion
Ticking by your call
You're the wiser one disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees  But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down 
Look how you want me now that I don't need you  
So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper  will you leave your man?  
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me 
I won't stand by you  Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down 
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes and settle for wrong
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did me before 
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you  Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head  And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool  Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone  I'll leave just hold me closer baby
And make me crazy for you 
Crazy for you  Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin 
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you  My oh my how my blood boils it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood  I keep on trying fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into  Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you 
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain 
But it's in my roots it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea 
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No I can't go back but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain 
It's in my roots it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain 
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea 
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea 
I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been if it hadn't been for love yes
If it hadn't been if it hadn't been for love yes Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I I lack desire
Forgive me first love forgive me first love forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me first love This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away I'm stolen Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together Let the skyfall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together
Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the skyfall 
When it crumbles
We will stand tall 
Face it all together Let the skyfall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away 
Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up then leave me dead I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too 
You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette 
Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too 
When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her 
Why do you love me
Do you love me   ?
Why do you love me
Do you love me?
Why do you love me
Do you love me? Why do you love me   ? Why do you love me do you love me?
Why do you love me do you love me?
Why do you love me do you love me?
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me    Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel it feels right It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark let the fires away
Are you ready ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part you were the first
I am ready ready It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me    Why do you love me do you love me?
Why do you love me do you love me?
Why do you love me do you love me?
Why do you love me do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other
Think we'll never match at all but we do
But we do but we do but we do I thought I knew myself somehow you know me more
I've never known this never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous I'm so very cautious combining
You think we would and we do
But we do but we do but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception 
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other
Think we'll never match at all but we do 
In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make 
What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
Summer Winter Spring and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you Wait do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me 
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say 
I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me
 But despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you 
And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true never true
And the games you play
You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true never true
And the games you play
You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn [Adele]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to   
Every part of me
All my words to hold
And hold against me
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
'til the morning!
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me why won't you let it be? 
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby won't you turn off the lights Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down
Lay me down Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby won't you turn off the lights Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
Didn't show emotions don't know why
Didn't wanna feel the pain inside I guess But as the years keep going by
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me
I should let you find me
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me
through the ups and downs
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
'cause you and me we're good
And I'll tell you why this hurts 'cause I'm sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
'cause I do but I really don't want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I start wishing for that thing and I don't need you
I don't really wanna see you
and I don't want you to see me
you would think that I was crazy
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I'd rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip 'o wine
'cause right now it's the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough I still think we could
(I'm not drunk enough)
'cause you and me we're good
'cause I'm sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
('cause you and me we're good)
Even when I've had too much
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I must my way
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
You're leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have?
For a little confidence I'll grab 
But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone 
You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on 
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all Baby I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on  Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look more I find
So let's go back there back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other nothing is easy enough So let's go back there back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'cause you're the only one I want yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No I'm never gonna leave you no Go ahead go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year 
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Let it out let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all  Yeah there's many shades of black  
Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Go ahead
Oh baby
I feel so down
Oh and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door Well I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh baby I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles But the people
They don't understand
No girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh baby
Don't feel so down
Oh and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I I turned around
Oh baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah Oh people

No girlfriends

In spaceships
They won't understand
And me

Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door yeah Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here Find yourself a girl
And settle down
Live a simple life
In a quiet town Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) So steady as she goes Your friends have shown
A kink
In the single life
You've had
Too much to think
Now you need a wife Steady as she goes

So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) Well here we go again
You've found yourself
A friend
That knows you well
But no matter

You'll always feel
As though you
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes When you have completed
What you thought
You had to do
And your blood's
Depleted
To the point
Of stable glue Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along Steady as she goes

You've found yourself

As though you
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes Settle for a girl
(Settle for a girl)
Neither up or down
Sell it to the crowd
That is gathered round

Neither up or down
Sell it to the crowd
That is gathered round

Are you steady now?

Steady as she goes
Are you steady now? Steady as she goes I'm insane in the brain
You're not already   
Feel the pain running through my veins
Don't you piss me off pretentious ostentatious
Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me 
Oh yesterday came suddenly Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday 
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday 
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be 
And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer let it be
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
There will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be 
And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow let it be
I wake up to the sound of music Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be
There will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe 
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me  Jai Guru Deva  Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world Images of broken light which
Dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe 
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world Sounds of laughter shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me 
Limitless undying love which
Shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Hey Jude don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better Hey Jude don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better And anytime you feel the pain hey Jude refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah Hey Jude don't let me down
You have found her now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better So let it out and let it in hey Jude begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you hey Jude you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah Hey Jude don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah hey Jude There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life-- I love you more Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free Blackbird fly blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night Blackbird fly blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's all right Little darling it's been a long cold lonely winter

Ah Love love love There's nothing you can do that can't be done 
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung 
Nothing you can say but you can learn
How to play the game
It's easy 
Nothing you can make that can't be made 
No one you can save that can't be saved 
Nothing you can do but you can learn
How to be you in time
It's easy  All you need is love all you need is love
All you need is love love  Love is all you need 
Love love love love love love love love love 
All you need is love all you need is love
All you need is love Love is all you need  
There's nothing you can know that isn't known 
Nothing you can see that isn't shown 
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where
You're meant to be
It's easy  All you need is love all you need is love
All you need is love love  Love is all you need 
All you need is love  (All together now)

Of lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I loved them all And with all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these mem'ries lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new And I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I loved you more And I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before

In my life I loved you more
In my life I loved you more Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you know you can't tune it
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever Always know sometimes it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a  Yes

Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly girl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand 
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing  
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band  
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening he's a singer with the band 
And if you want some fun sing ob la di bla da

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps  I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you  I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps  I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you  I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping

Is equal to the love you make I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on Woke up fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on Michelle ma belle
These are words that go together well
I love you I love you I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
I need to I need to I need to
I need to make you see
Oh what you mean to me
Until I do I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you    I want you I want you I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know 
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say  Hello   On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
And little children laugh at him behind his back 
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain very strange  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen 
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer  Meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray 
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway  In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain very strange  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back 
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 
There beneath the blue suburban skies

Love is all love is you Because the sky is blue it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and look so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Man junior behave yourself Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now junior behave yourself Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
He took your canary and he fed it to the neighbors cat
He gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well mama's head has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now junior behave yourself I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me

Many years from now 
Will you still be sending me a Valentine 
Birthday greetings bottle of wine 
If I'd been out till quarter to three 
Would you lock the door 
Will you still need me will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four 
You'll be older too
And if I say the word
I could stay with you 
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone 
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday morning go for a ride
Doing the garden digging the weeds
Who could ask for more 
Will you still need me will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four 
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera Chuck&Dave;
Send me a postcard drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Your's sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me will you still feed me

The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt  Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  To lead a better life
I need my love to be here Here making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there I will be there
And everywhere
Here there and everywhere I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met 
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware 
But as it is I'll dream of her Tonight 
Falling yes I am falling And she keeps calling
Me back again  I have never known
The like of this I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this di-di-di-di'n'di  Falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again  Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup! Falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again  I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met 
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met mm-mm-mm-di-di-di  Falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again  Falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again  Oh falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again  Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today    Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too Imagine all the people
Living life in peace You you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will be as one Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world You you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will live as one The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door Oh I need your love babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you Hold me love me hold me love me

All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl
You want so much it make you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
Ah girl girl girl When I think of all the times
I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah girl girl girl She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool ooh oo oo oo
Girl girl girl Was she told when she was young
That pain would lead to pleasure
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back
To earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead
Ah girl girl girl
Girl I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
He'd let us in knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden in the shade I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus' garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade  We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus' garden near a cave We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe) We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden with you  One two three four
Can I have a little more
Look at me All together now
All together now
All together now Black white green red
Can I take my friend to bed
Pink brown yellow orange and blue
I love you All together now
All together now
Bom bom bom bompa bom

Skip the rope bompa bom
Look at me All together now

Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her 'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you I'm so tired I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No no no I'm so tired I don't know what to do
I'm so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind I'm so tired I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind Sheepdog standing in the rain
Bullfrog doing it again

Measured out in miles

Something special when you smile Childlike no one understands
Jackknife in your sweaty hands

To listen to your fears You can talk to me

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round Oh You Never Give Me Your Money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations you break down
I never give you my number
I only give my situation
And in the middle of investigation I break down
Out of college money spent
See no future pay no rent
All the money's gone nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning turning back
Yellow lorry slow nowhere to go
But oh that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes it did

Mean Mr  Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark tryin to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy him some clothes
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man
His sister Pam works in the shop
She never stops; she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah yeah yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
Who makes the News Of The World
Yes you could say that she's attractively built
Yeah yeah yeah
(John) She's coming in the house
(Paul) Oh look out!
She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby 
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said  I'm gonna get that boy 
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said  Danny boy this is a showdown 
But Daniel was hot he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said  Rocky you met your match 
And Rocky said  Doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better I'll be better Doc as soon as I am able  Now Rocky Raccoon 
he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night
We can work it out
We can work it out Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out

Came down upon his head 
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead  Whoa oh oh oh

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away How can I even try?

I will break these chains that bind me happiness will find me
leave the past behind me today my life begins
a whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins Yesterday has come and gone
And I've learnt how to leave it where it is
And I see that I was wrong
For ever doubting I could win Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same
all around me i can feel a change I will break these chains that bind me 
happiness will find me
leave the past behind me today my life begins
a whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins Life's too short to have regrets
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
only have one life to live
So you better make the best of it I will break these chains that bind me
 happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins I will break these chains that bind me 
happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins
Today my life begins    Everyday I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today 
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me 
As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life 
Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one 
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me 
As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it Look at me when I'm talkin' to you
You looking at me but I'm lookin' through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself I'm looking at the Mirror on the wall here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again Uh I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you re all alone
And you correct me when I'm lookin' wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pain
I see the scars that remain
I see you Wayne I'm lookin' at the Mirror on the wall here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again Lookin' at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fuckin' dad
Light it up that's smoke at mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my momma smile that's a blessin'
I see the change I see the message
And no message could been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the Mirror on the wall 
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again
Uh Mirror on the wall here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again

One drag for my sorrow 
Get messed up today
I'll be ok tomorrow 
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow 
Get messed up today

Singing to the city lights

So I'll be out here 'til they call the cops  'Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose

Now greetings to the world! You best believe! She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair she's out there Somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn Little miss perfect sitting at the train stop
Red Nike high tops listening to hip-hop
While we were waiting started conversating
Before I got her name along came a train (uh) next stop Brooklyn

Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair she's out there
Somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere in Brooklyn On the street kickin' rocks circling the same block
Green farm flat bush checking every corner shop
Tappin' people's shoulders askin' if they know her
Everyday's the same back to the train (uh) next stop Brooklyn
(uh) I'm still lookin' She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair she's out there
Somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere somewhere somewhere in Brooklyn Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh

I hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn Ooh-ooh-ooh Girl I bet your momma named you goodlookin'
'Cause you sure look good to me
My attention oh yes you just took it
You're probably the finest thing that I ever seen
And nobody at the party droppin' it low like the way that you do
Got me sayin'  damn girl break it down for me  
Take it nice and slow let me watch while you turn around

Wait wait wait for you oh See you down there everyday
Trying to find a different way
To build some kind of ladder to the sky Trying to find some way to see
Secrets of eternity and they don't come all at once
And you don't know why Well how do you think it feels to hear you screaming out my name
While all the while I'm trying to open up your heart
See you when you cry yourself to sleep
It's tearing me apart I know you wish you could see me
That's the way it has to be
Someday you'll understand
Don't you lose your faith in me I know you wish you could hear me
Sometimes it's so hard to do
But every morning sunrise it says
I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you I know that you're waiting for
A chance to come in from the war
If only a moment if only a day A place where you feel safe and warm
A sanctuary from the storm
Until all of these questions fade away But I cannot count on all the signs
You've passed away as mere coincidence
And I'm running out of ways to break through
Like a lonely lover Waiting by the ocean
I'll never give up on you I know you wish you could see me
That's the way it has to be
Someday you'll understand
Don't you lose your faith in me I know you wish you could hear me
Sometimes it's so hard to do
But every morning sunrise it says
I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you I got too many girls on hold for you to be so bold
Too many on my team for you to act so mean

And she did it for fun
Natalie she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone

Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming

Natalie she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day baby
While I hide from the sun It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like
Until you try You know I I'll be waiting on the other side
And you all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side We would live forever
Who could ask for more
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like
Until you try You know I I'll be waiting on the other side
And you all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side If they say life's a dream
Call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland
It damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line
You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster
But I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly
I've been feeling insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
Cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we pay when we living on the other side You know I I'll be waiting on the other side
And you all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side It's better if you don't understand

voices in my head
Look at her shinin'
Her feathers they glow
Now the jungle's smiling
'Cause our baby's home
Can you feel what I feel?
The day has come at last
Our precious jewel has returned
I'll be the first to say welcome back
Oh welcome back I say welcome welcome welcome
Back Oh her eyes her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah I know I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me  Do I look okay?  
I say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah Her lips her lips I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday Oh you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay you know I'll say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are Yeah Oh i was perfect
For the circus
if she dared me i do it
Love makes you stupid
i gave it up But i guess it was not enough
Cause she never seemed satisfied
i Know i'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is ?
she wanted someone that's perfect
Well Okay
But can you tell me Who is ?
Oohh she set the bar
Just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it
But i still kept on reaching
she watched me try
At least a thousand times
If she loved me She'd stop me But noo
i Know i'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is ?
she wanted someone that's perfect
Well Okay
But can you tell me Who is ?
I saw something worth my future
So wrong So wrong
In my mind i was all it took
But i guess i wasn't wrong
i Know i'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is ?
she wanted someone that's perfect
Well Okay
But can you tell me Who is ?

It's getting hard to breathe
I'm trying to make her see
That she don't really know
That I'm trying to find a way
And tell her every day that she just goes along   
I don't wanna be
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing shaking ground
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time 
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost  I'm already lost  I wish that I could see
What is making you
Feel that you should be concerned 
My love is like a gunshot
All it takes is one shot for me to blow it all away 
I don't wanna feel like I'm just wasting time
It's gotta be with you and no one else 
Do you notice me
I need to know right now
Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time 
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost  Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl you make me nervous
By now you should have noticed me 
And what will it take it
To a heavenly because your
drawing chains and
driving me insane! Chorus:
GirlI'm losing my head
I'm losing control of myself this time 
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost  Hands over my head thinking
What else could go wrong
Would've stayed in bed
How could a day be so long? Never believe that things
Happen for a reason
But how this turned out
Removed all my doubt so believe That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you I missed the first train stood out
In the rain all day
But I caught the next train
And there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for Never believed that things
Happen for a reason
But how this turned out
Removed all my doubt So believe that for you
I'd do it all over again do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again Oh who ever thought a day gone
So wrong could turn out so lovely
Yeah I'm so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong
I wouldn't change a thing Yeah yeah I'ma do it
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again Do it all over again I'd do it all over again
I'd do all over again for you
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely Everyday I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today 
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me 
As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one 
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me 
As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Once again you're home alone
Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby Everyday same old things
So used to feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel it's broken
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows
You've been livin this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one your looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see Everyday same old things
So used to feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel it's broken
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows
All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know It can
Other words are spring to me
emolicious for the shoot posses no And you want me to respect you
And have for yourself
You're out of control with nobody around to help
Help help oh oh 
This time you're on your own
Running back to mommy hoping that she's home
But if she's not there and you're on your alone
So    you then go calling
Call it a fiasco call it a fiasco fiasco
Wanna try to testify in a of happiness
Be the best have success
Doesn't mean you're Hollywood Feel blessed not impressed
By the glamour if you think you could  And you want me to respect you
And have for yourself
You're out of control with nobody around to help
Help help oh oh
This time you're on your own
Running about the mammy hoping that she's home
But if she's not there and you're on your alone
So you then go calling Fiasco 
Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here I can make it anywhere that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway

Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it I think I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready I know you said to me
 This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be 
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it I know I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you Oh oh I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you Oh baby
I I I I'm fallin'
Fall I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you

The way that I love you I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you

The way that I love you What? Even if you were a million miles away
I can still feel you in my bed
Near me touch me feel me And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Telling me touch me feel me
And all the time you were telling me lies So tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you 
Have you ever try sleeping with a broken heart?
Well you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely own me nobody ever shut it down like you 
You wore the crown you made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me need me
I thought you told me you'd never leave me Looking in the sky I could see your face
Then I knew right where I fit in
Take me make me you know that I'll always be in love with you
Right till the end So tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you 
Anybody could've told you right from the start it's 'bout to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream I'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight So tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

To come home before the sun

Cause no one knows
Me underneath these clothes

You don't know my name
I see us on our first date
Doing everything that makes me smile
When we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh it set my soul on fire Ooh baby baby baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's running wild It feels like ooh
You don't know my name
And I swear it baby it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
I'm sayin' he don't even know what he's doin' to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin' like oh
Doing nothing I've ever done
For anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you 'Cause did I mention
You bout' to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels
To have all my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin'
'Cause my lovin' feels like Ooh
You don't know my name
And I swear it feels like
You don't my name You don't know my name
Baby baby I swear
It's like
Ooh You don't know my name
It feels like
And you don't my name
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like
Will you ever know? You could buy me diamonds
You could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
Baby you know I'm worth it
Dinner lit by candles
Run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last to last
'Cause baby you know I'm worth it Wanna please wanna keep wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth 
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth If you treat me fairly
I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
Baby I know you're worth it
If you never play me
Promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
'Cause baby I know you're worth it She walks the mile makes you smile all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth 
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth 
No need to read between the lines spelled out for you
Just hear this song 'cause you can't go wrong when you value
Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first 
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth 'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth Here's my ghetto story
Been in hell through the fire
Now we gonna take it higher
Here's my survival story
So many reasons to sing this
Now we got the keys to the kingdom I remember those days when hell was my home
When Me and Mama bed was a big piece a foam
An mi never like bathe and my hair never comb
When Mama gone a work me go street go roam
I remember when Danny dem take me snow cone
An make him likkle bredda dem kick up Jerome
I remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone
An the boy Danny pop out something weh full chrome
I remember when we run Fatta get him knee blown
An mi best friend Richie get two inna him dome
I remember so the avenue tun inna war zone
An Mikey madda fly him out cause she get a loan
But Mikey go to foreign and go tun Al Capone
Mek whole heap a money and sen in our own
Now a we a lock the city and that is well known
Yesterday Mikey call me pan mi phone
Mi say Mikey We get di ting dem dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruke no
Rah rah rah rah We got the kingdom so we got to make way
We take it from the bottom to the top baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
Rah rah rah rah I remember those days when we was dead broke an
I could barely find a dolla for a token
Hop in the train to just get where I'm going
Hobos after me runnin' like I'm smokin'
Remember those days when I went to bed hungry
All I ever ate was white rice and honey
Big dreams in my head empty my tummy
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin' funny I remember playin' over needles in the streets
Everywhere I go a man want some part of me
Dirty Dirty hookas and hoes on 11th avenue
Sellin' bodies for doh
Remember cryin' sayin' that will never be me
Gonna make it someday gonna be somebody
Say mommy donâ??t worry cause its just u and me
One day we will get out of this misery We get di ting dem dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk no
Rah rah rah rah We got the kingdom so we got to make way
We take it from the bottom to the top baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
Rah rah rah rah Here's my ghetto story
Been in hell through the fire
Now we gonna take it higher
Here's my survival story
So many reasons to sing this
I thought that you'd be happy
I found the one thing I need why you mad
It's just the brand new kind of me It took a long long time to get here
It took a brave brave girl to try
It took one too many excuses one too many lies
Don't be surprised don't be surprised if i talk a little louder
If I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller
I'd be known to you too long
If you noticed that I'm different
Don't take it personally
Don't be mad it's just the brand new kind of me
And it ain't bad I found a brand new kind of free Oh it took a long long road to get here
It took a brave brave girl to try
I've taken one too many excuses one too many lies
Don't be surprised oh see you look surprised Hey if you were a friend you want to get know me again
If you were worth a while
You'd be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry
I'm too busy finding myself
I got this
I found me I found me yeah I don't need your opinion
I'm not waiting for your okay
I'll never be perfect but at least now I'm brave
Now my heart is open
And I can finally breathe
Don't be mad it's just the brand new kind of free
That ain't bad I found a brand new kind of me
Don't be mad it's just a brand new time for me We're at the crossroads my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go maybe you'll stay
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
It's such a lonely road
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears
When I cry your name
Am I crawling in bed
Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
Don't you do it
No said don't you leave me this way
I don't know
If I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh it's such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears
You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had'
Was it everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again Oh oh oh How many really know what love is'
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
You're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I been looking for I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me againOh oh oh oh oh This song is dedicated
To all the lovers who cant be together
Separated by distance and time You were always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now? Know I never let you down
I will never go away I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dream about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home home home No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time I'll be waiting Distance and time I'll be waiting
Will you take a train to meet me where I am
Are you on your way?
And I will never do anything to hurt you
I'll never live without you I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dreamed about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home home home No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Distance and time I'll be waiting
And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time
I'll be waiting No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time I'll be waiting
And you can walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Through distance and time I'll be waiting Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh hey
Oh oh oh oh I'll be waiting
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting You are always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now? JW: Another ringer with the slick trigger finger for Her Majesty
One with the golden gun poison in your fantasy
Another bill from a killer turned a thrill into a tragedy
A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think that you can trust is just
Another tricky little gun giving solace to the one that will never see the sunshine
Another inch of your life sacrificed for your brother in the nick of time
Another dirty money heaven sent honey turning on a dime 
Its just another way to Hey Its just another way to You have got to 
Another girl with her finger on the world singing do what you wanna hear
Another gun thrown down and surrendered took away your fear
Another man that stands right behind you looking in the mirror 
Its just another way Suit em up bang bang! Bang bang bang bang  
Said I'd be gone by five
But it's sun rise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Me re-playing memories in my head
Look at you look at you
Look what you made me do
How do you how do you think know my every move
Who are you Who are you You look so familiar
I know you I know you baby I know the truth We got way too much in common

You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too We used to talk 'til midnight
All those days that you stayed at my house
We were just passing the time
When we were young and we ain't had no vows
Now now now maybe later on I'll text you and maybe you'll reply
We both know we had no patience together day and night
Getting high on our supply yeah we ain't satisfied
I could love you all occasions We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you Who wants to love somebody like me?

Driving in a fast car
Trying to get somewhere
Don't know where I'm going
But I gotta get there
I'm singing for somebody like you
Walking down the sideway
Looking for innocence
Trying to find my way
Trying to make some sense
I'm singing for somebody like you
What about you

'Cause there's something about you there
Speaks to my heart
Speaks to my soul
I'm singing for someone
Sorta like you
Someone like you someone like me
Looking for paradise

Oh oh oh oh She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy longer like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe but she knows she can fly away
Oh she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Looks like a girl but she's a flame
So bright she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say
Oh we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire Everybody stands as she goes by
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn baby burn baby This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
Oh oh oh
She's just a girl and she's on fire Used to dream of being a millionaire without a care
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
'Cause it's over
That just wont be fair
Darling
Rather be a poor woman living on the street
No food to eat
'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
'Cause it's over
When you said goodbye! All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone Now I see myself through different eyes
It's no surprise!
Being alone will make you realize
When it's over!
All in love is fair I shoulda been there
I shoulda been there I shoulda shoulda All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone I know I pushed you away
What can I do that would save our love
Take these material things
They don't mean nothing
It's you that I want All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar
Seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone I shoulda been there
I shoulda been there I shoulda I shoulda All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar
Seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone Get so caught up everyday
Tryna keep it all together
While the time it slips away
You see I know nothing last forever Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There would be no limit to my sorrow
So all I can say I wanna tell you something give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers waste another hour let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something show you something won't wait till it's too late 
(I can't wait I can't wait I won't wait I don't wanna wait)
(I can't wait I can't wait I won't wait I don't wanna wait) Just a simple conversation
Just a moment is all it takes
I wanna be there just to listen
(I wanna be here)
And I don't wanna hesitate Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There would be no limit to my sorrow
'Cause there's nothing that could fill that space
I don't wanna put it off for too long
I didn't say all that I had to say
I wanna take my time and right the wrong before we get to that place
 I wanna tell you something give you something

I can't wait I can't wait I won't wait I don't wanna wait Oooh oooh Grew up in a town
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby I'm from 
New York concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York New York New York On the avenue there ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah yeah yeah  Said I'd be gone by five
But it's sun rise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Me re-playing memories in my head
Look at you look at you
Look what you made me do

With the slick
Trigger finger
For her majesty
Another one
With the
Golden tone voice
And then your fantasy
Another bill
From a killer
Turned a thrill
Into a tragedy Yeah a door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die Another tricky little gun
Giving solace to the one
That will never see
The sunshine
Another inch of your life
Sacrificed
For your brother
In the nick of time
Another dirty money
Heaven sent honey
Turning on a dime Well a door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die He
Another girl
With her finger
On the world singing
Do what you want here
Another gun thrown down
And surrendered
Took away your fear
Hey
Another man
That stands right
Behind you
Looking in the mirror A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die
It's just another way
It's just another way
Baby Baby Weren't you the one that said
That you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space
And give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried
And tried to make you stay with me
But still you said the love was gone
And that I had to leave talkin' bout a family
Now you sayin' I complete your dream
Now you sayin' I'm your everything
You're confusing me what you say to me
Don't play with me don't play with me 'cause What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's cryin' desirin' to come back to me
Now who's cryin' desirin' to come back I remember when I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn' And when you came home
You'd always have some sorry excuse
Half explaining to me
Like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want
Just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through wanna be up under me
you have so much to say to me hey
Now you want to make time for me
What you do to me your confusing me
Don't play with me don't play with me
Now who's cryin desirin' to come back to me
Now who's cryin desirin' to come back I remember when I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn'
Night after night knowing somethin' goin' on
Wasn't long before I be g-g-gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what you supposed to do
No need to approach me boo 'cause I'm over you 
Now who's cryin' desirin' to come back to me
Gotta stop cryin' to come back to me 
He's cryin' cryin my baby
And it goes around
Now who's cryin' desirin' to come back to me Can't wait till I get home
Baby dial your number
Can you pick up the phone
Cause I wanna holla
Daydreamin' about you all day in school cant concentrate
Wanna have your voice in my ear till mama come and say its too late
Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
Cause I just don't want to say goodbye
Cause you are my baby baby
Nothing really matters
I don't really care what nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
Its a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair Another secret meeting
On the fifth floor staircase
I'm gonna give you this letter
Of all the things I can't say
Want u to be my first my last my ending and beginning
I write your name in my book your last name my first I'm your Mrs 
Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide

It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair
Nothing really matters There's no other way
That I would want someone to hold me
Show me like you falling in a daze
So many ways I'm in amazement Thinking about you no one took the time
To hold my mind and be the kind
That I could talk to this is the type of day
That I must say I've been looking forward to Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here
They just don't know how good it feels Feels so good to not be searching
Searching just to find that someone
Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love Talking on the phone
When I'm alone I'm in the zone
And tempted to touch you
Nothing ever fades The way you take time for me
It makes me want you call it what you want
It may be wrong but baby I'm your fool
I can verify that you're my type
The things we try that others just won't do Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here
They just don't know how good it feels Feels so good to not be searching
Searching just to find that someone
Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love Some people they call me crazy
For falling in love with you
They can take me and lock me away baby
'Cause there is nothing those bars can do I will be the rising moon after setting sun
Just to let you know that you'll always have someone
I will be the clearest day when the rain is done
So you will always know Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is I use to feel kinda lonely
'Cause the world it can be so fake
And all that matters I'm telling you
Is you and me only
And the fortunes of love we make I will be the water you need in the desert land
Just to let you know you will always have my hand
I will be the woman you need to be a better man
So you will always know Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is Oh can nothing break us down
Oh cause we are heaven bound
Like the mountain standing tall
And moving over here to stay
Oh can nothing get in the way Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is Through the deepest water
I won't let you drown
That's how strong my love is
Like the moon in the sky
That it would never come down
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is He broke my heart
And it was raining
Just to rub it in
I'm at your door
I feel so crazy about it
You'll say I told you so
You saw it long ago
You knew he had to go
I finally came 'round
I'm back on solid ground
Can't let it get me down It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright 
It's alright It's alright It's alright Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Sometimes
Some lies
Can take a minute
To fully realize
His tears
Your eyes
Thirty seconds to apologize
You give it one more chance
Just like the time before
But he already know you'd give a hundred more
Until that night in bed
You wake up in a sweat
You're racing to the door
Can't take it anymore I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Life perfect
Ain't perfect
If you don't know what the struggle's for
Falling down ain't falling down
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called the past cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before
You ought to see me now Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned I keep your picture upside my bed 
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong 
Always thought you'll be by my side
Pappa now you're gone
What I wanna know baby if what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore Still like a fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when you holding me tight
Everybody said everybody said that we should never part no no
Telling me baby baby baby why
Why you wanna go and break my heart
All I wanna know is baby if what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me pappa
Oh you got to try
I'll get down on me knees hoping you please
Won't you call me sometime pappa Why don't you call me
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me
How come you don't call me
How come you don't call me There's a hole in my heart I've been hiding
I've been strong for so long that I'm blind
Is there a place I can go where the lonely river flows?
Where fear ends and faith begins Hallelujah hallelujah let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah hallelujah let me in Every step makes me think that I'm closer
But somehow I just never arrived
When our hope disappears please protect me from my tears
Please forgive me for my sins
Uh you know hey
You know you may think
That you know you got me under wraps locks and keys and
And that without you I just I'm gonna be lost
But I got somethin' else for you Baby I used to sit home waitin' for your call
I used to have your picture hangin' on my wall
Used to think you were right but you was wrong
I used to miss you now I'm glad that you're gone I
uh Baby I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more
Baby I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more 'Cause I'm the juiciest baby girl around
And I got 999 men knockin' on down my door
'Cause I'm the juiciest baby girl around
And I don't care if you don't call no more We used to light a fire on a rainy night
I used to like it when you'd come and hold me tight
I used to believe we would never part no
But now I've had a change of heart whoa    Baby I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more

Wait til they see your smile If war is holy and sex is obscene
We've got it twisted in this lucid dream
Baptized in boundaries schooled in sin
Divided by difference sexuality and skin Oh so we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in yourself locked in
Yeah we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in yourself locked Oh maybe we should love somebody
Oh maybe we could care a little more
So maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if sex was holy and war was obscene
And it wasn't twisted what a wonderful dream
Living for love unafraid of the end
Forgiveness is the only real revenge Oh so we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open yourself open
Yeah we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open you're open So maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
So maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if love is holy and hate obscene
We should give life to this beautiful dream
'Cause peace and love ain't so far
If we nurse our wounds before they scar
Nurse our wounds before they scar There will never come a day
You will ever hear me say
That I want or need to be without you
I wanna give my all Baby just hold me
Sweetly control me
Because your arms
they keep away the lonely When I look into your eyes
Then I realize
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life 'Cause I never felt this way about loving
Never felt so alive
Never felt this way about loving
It feels so good And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior this is for you and I
This is for euphoria give me a piece of mind
God is recording this! won't you look in the sky?
Tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence only last a minute
Land on your dreams and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley of peace with bare feet
Run through the flames that's more passion for me
I passed that this morning just so the world can see
Got them wolves on me no watch me like em clean
I know i know my pride my ghost my eyes
My lows i know i know its mind control
I know i could prosper no impostor
Prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by it what I am a freedom fighter the name that history wrote
And even through disaster eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired gold is the only word i know And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off get off get off get off
I bet you wonder how I go on Ill simply say its on again its on again
The world don't stop it's on again I am a lonely hero trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness i sacrifice my ego
There is no room for selfish we do it for the people And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second losin' focus

By the second losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off get off get off get off
I bet you wonder how I go on Some people live for the fortune

Every hood in every state
Don't have no reasons 'cause relief is hard to find 
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin'
A lot of footsteps to follow I've been steppin'
Mind stressin' tryin' to find a record crime shreddin'
Time precious I ain't have rest since nine eleven I live fast hustle like today is my last
I get cash the struggle's like a day on the Ave 
Crack bein' raw gats squeezin' off
Manhattan squeezin' off from cats who tease with war 
The eve of the Apocalypse evil keep movin' politics
Every block is at risk the metropolitan metropolis
The opposite of Liza Minelli and Frank Sinatra
Alicia Keys Nas and Ra the gangsta's opera So New York City walk with me talk gritty

Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted
But I can't explain 'cause I'm so guarded But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long long way to heaven
But I gotta get there Can you send an angel?
Can you send an angel? 'Cause I don't wanna feel
Like a dove with no wings
And I don't wanna know
What a heart of stone would bring But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long long way to heaven
But I gotta get there Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Please send me an angel
Can you send me an angel? To guide me to guide me home
[Incomprehensible] so bad so bad right now
Oh won't you be somebody's angel right now And the day came
When the risk it took to remain tightly closed in a bud
Was more painfully than the risk it took to bloom
This is the element of freedom I'll make the darkness light before you
What is wrong I'll make it right before you
All the battles I will fight down for you
And the high place I'll bring down  And the high place I'll bring down How do you love someone
That hurts you oh so bad
With intentions good?
Was all he ever had Well how do I let go when I've loved him for so long
And I've given him all that I could? Maybe love is a hopeless crime

Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab

For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means

That's what I'm telling myself
But I'm lying to myself

These arms are wantin' you
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win These candles
Light up my room at night
But they can't light the room they way you did
When you walked inside oh baby If these walls could sing
About everything they've witnessed

When everything in this room reminds me of you 
Every time I think I'm getting closer
'Cause tears drown me out once again I lose 'Cause these lips are missin' you 
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you 
I put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you 
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you

Oh I'm not worried about tomorrow
Cause tomorrow may not come
And where my heart take me I follow you gotta follow When they lay me down put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love you when it's all over

I wanna be somebody be somebody
And I wanna go somewhere go somewhere Back to life baby
Climb out from the bottom baby

Foot on the pedal baby it's time to find what you're made of
Everybody wants to be adored
You don't have to settle for being enough Back to life
Back to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive
Oh oh oh oh yeah

If a bird don't fly then what were wings made for?
Oh I'm not meant to be locked up
And if I don't try then what was I made for? Back to life
Bck to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive
Oh oh oh oh yeah
Back to life Right now I feel like a bird
caged without a key
Ev'ryone comes to stare at me
with so much joy and reverie
They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile I cry They don't know what they're doing to me
keeping me from flying
That's why I say that I know why
the caged bird sings
Only joy comes from song She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free
so she can fly fly fly
spreading her wings and her song?
Let her fly fly fly

Fly fly ooh just let her fly

I'll be here forever Ayo mo bee
Drop it on me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Let's do it like this uh If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb If you had the strength
To walk out my door
My love would over-rule my sense
And I'd call you back for more If I was your woman
If I was your woman
And you were my man yeah She tears you down darling
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up darling
When she lets you fall 'Cause you're like a diamond
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me you won't ask If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman Here's what I'd do
I'd never never no no no stop loving you
Yeah yeah Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she was first darling
Will she hang on your mind You're a part of me
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman Here's what I'd do
I'd never never no no no stop loving you If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never never never stop loving you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman We're at the crossroads my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go maybe you'll stay
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
It's such a lonely road
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears
When I cry your name
Am I crawling in bed
Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
Don't you do it
No said don't you leave me this way
I don't know
If I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh it's such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears
You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears Is it my turn to wish you was lying here?
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
Or even imagine your emotions tell myself anything Is it my turn to take you by your hands?
Tell you I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand?
Watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing If I have to give away every feeling that I feel
If I have to sacrifice oh whatever babe whatever baby 
There must be some way out of here  said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth 
No reason to get excited  the thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now the hour is getting late 
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
While all the women came and went barefoot servants too
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching the wind began to howl										 
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime didn't you?
People'd call say  Beware doll you're bound to fall 
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
You've gone to the finest school all right Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him do you want to make a deal?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're drinkin' thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
But you'd better lift your diamond ring you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now he calls you you can't refuse
When you got nothing you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now you got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?										 
Oh God said to Abraham  Kill me a son 
Abe says  Man you must be puttin' me on 
God say  No   Abe say  What? 
God say  You can do what you want Abe but
The next time you see me comin' you better run 
Well Abe says  Where do you want this killin' done? 
God says  Out on Highway 61 
Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said there's only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
Ol' Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down on Highway 61
Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
I got forty red white and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61
Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
He was tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61										 
Early one mornin' the sun was shinin'
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through
Tangled up in blue
She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder
We'll meet again someday on the avenue 
Tangled up in blue
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Tangled up in blue
She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me  Don't I know your name? 
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
I thought you'd never say hello  she said
You look like the silent type 
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
So now I'm goin' back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenters' wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives
But me I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
Tangled up in blue										 
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes 'n' how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
Yes 'n' how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes 'n' how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see?
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes 'n' how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind										 
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say  Who is that man? 
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you'll say
When you get home
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you Mister Jones?
You raise up your head
And you ask  Is this where it is? 
And somebody points to you and says
It's his 
And you say  What's mine? 
And somebody else says  Where what is? 
And you say  Oh my God
Am I here all alone? 
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you Mister Jones?
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says  How does it feel
To be such a freak? 
And you say  Impossible 
As he hands you a bone
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you Mister Jones?
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you Mister Jones?
Well the sword swallower he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says  Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan 
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you Mister Jones?
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word  NOW 
And you say  For what reason? 
And he says  How? 
And you say  What does this mean? 
And he screams back  You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home 
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you Mister Jones?
Well you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you Mister Jones?										 
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well I wake in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin' me insane
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
No I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Well he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If you're havin' a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
No I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
Well he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
No I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
Well she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She's the brains behind pa
She's sixty-eight but she says she's twenty-four
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They sing while you slave and I just get bored
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more										 
Well they'll stone ya when you're trying to be so good
They'll stone ya just a-like they said they would
They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to go home
Then they'll stone ya when you're there all alone
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
Well they'll stone ya when you're walkin' 'long the street
They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to keep your seat
They'll stone ya when you're walkin' on the floor
They'll stone ya when you're walkin' to the door
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
They'll stone ya when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone ya when you are young and able
They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to make a buck
They'll stone ya and then they'll say  good luck 
Tell ya what I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
Well they'll stone you and say that it's the end
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar
Yes but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
Well they'll stone you when you walk all alone
They'll stone you when you are walking home
They'll stone you and then say you are brave
They'll stone you when you are set down in your grave
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned										 
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe
It don't matter anyhow
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice it's all right
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light babe
That light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice it's all right
It ain't no use in callin' out my name gal
Like you never did before
It ain't no use in callin' out my name gal
I can't hear you anymore
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice it's all right
I'm walkin' down that long lonesome road babe
Where I'm bound I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word gal
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice it's all right										 
Go 'way from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're lookin' for someone
Never weak but always strong
To protect you an' defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me babe
No no no it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for babe
Go lightly from the ledge babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want babe
I will only let you down
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you an' more
But it ain't me babe
No no no it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for babe
Go melt back into the night babe
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
An' anyway I'm not alone
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
An' to come each time you call
A lover for your life an' nothing more
But it ain't me babe
No no no it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for babe										 
Hey! Mr  Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr  Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
Hey! Mr  Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr  Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'
I'm ready to go anywhere I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it
Hey! Mr  Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr  Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
Though you might hear laughin' spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seein' that he's chasing
Hey! Mr  Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr  Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Hey! Mr  Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr  Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you										 
Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand o'er your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead										 
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Ev'rybody knows
That Baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
She takes just like a woman yes she does
She makes love just like a woman yes she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
Queen Mary she's my friend
Yes I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
That Baby can't be blessed
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
With her fog her amphetamine and her pearls
She takes just like a woman yes she does
She makes love just like a woman yes she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear that-
I just can't fit
Yes I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world
Ah you fake just like a woman yes you do
You make love just like a woman yes you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl										 
Summer days summer nights are gone
Summer days and the summer nights are gone
I know a place where there's still somethin' going on
I got a house on a hill I got hogs all out in the mud
I got a house on a hill I got hogs out lying in the mud
Got a long-haired woman she got royal Indian blood
Everybody get ready-lift your glasses and sing
Everybody get ready to lift your glasses and sing
Well I'm standin' on the table I'm proposing a toast to the King
Well I'm drivin' in the flats in a Cadillac car
The girls all say  You're a worn-out star 
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime
How can you say you love someone else when you know it's me all the time?
Well the fog's so thick you can't spy the land
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Wedding bells ringin' the choir is beginning to sing
Yes the wedding bells are ringing and the choir is beginning to sing
What looks good in the day at night is another thing
She's looking into my eyes she's holding my hand
She's looking into my eyes she's holding my hand
She says  You can't repeat the past   I say  You can't? What do you mean
you can't? Of course you can  
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Sorry that's nothin' you would need to know
Well my back has been to the wall for so long it seems like it's stuck
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck
I got eight carburetors boys I'm using 'em all
Well I got eight carburetors and boys I'm using 'em all
I'm short on gas my motor's starting to stall
My dogs are barking there must be someone around
My dogs are barking there must be someone around
I got my hammer ringin' pretty baby but the nails ain't goin' down
You got something to say speak or hold your peace
Well you got something to say speak now or hold your peace
If it's information you want you can go get it from the police
Politician got on his jogging shoes
He must be running for office got no time to lose
He been suckin' the blood out of the genius of generosity
You been rolling your eyes-you been teasing me
Standing by God's river my soul is beginnin' to shake
Standing by God's river my soul is beginnin' to shake
I'm countin' on you love to give me a break
Well I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift
Yes I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift
Gonna break the roof in-set fire to the place as a parting gift
Summer days summer nights are gone
Summer days summer nights are gone
I know a place where there's still somethin' going on										 
A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne
Got white skin got assassin's eyes
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
I'm well dressed waiting on the last train
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight I'm out of range
I used to care but things have changed
This place ain't doing me any good
I'm in the wrong town I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag
Ain't no shortcuts gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove
Lot of water under the bridge lot of other stuff too
Don't get up gentlemen I'm only passing through
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight I'm out of range
I used to care but things have changed
I've been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right the world will explode
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You can't win with a losing hand
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight I'm out of range
I used to care but things have changed
I hurt easy I just don't show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get low down gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
I'm in love with a woman who don't even appeal to me
Mr  Jinx and Miss Lucy they jumped in the lake
I'm not that eager to make a mistake
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight I'm out of range
I used to care but things have changed										 
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying
Pointed threats they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
Plays wasted words proves to warn
That he not busy being born is busy dying
Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be one more
Person crying
So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright Ma I'm only sighing
As some warn victory some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much is really sacred
While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked
An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright Ma I can make it
Advertising signs they con
You into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you
You lose yourself you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to
Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing Ma to live up to
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Cultivate their flowers to be
Nothing more than something they invest in
While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in
But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright Ma if I can't please him
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex they dare
To push fake morals insult and stare
While money doesn't talk it swears
Obscenity who really cares
Propaganda all is phony
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Graveyards false gods I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay I have had enough what else can you show me?
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright Ma it's life and life only										 
I'm walking through streets that are dead
Walking walking with you in my head
My feet are so tired my brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping
I'm sick of love but I'm in the thick of it
This kind of love I'm so sick of it
I see I see lovers in the meadow
I see I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them 'til they're gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow
I'm sick of love; I hear the clock tick
This kind of love; I'm love sick
Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Sometimes I feel like I'm being plowed under
Could you ever be true? I think of you
And I wonder
I'm sick of love; I wish I'd never met you
I'm sick of love; I'm trying to forget you
Just don't know what to do
I'd give anything to be with you										 
Oh the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block
I'd ask him what the matter was
But I know that he don't talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart
I know I can't escape
Oh Mama can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Well Shakespeare he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if she's talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked
Oh Mama can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
An' I said  Oh I didn't know that
But then again there's only one I've met
An' he just smoked my eyelids
An' punched my cigarette 
Oh Mama can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Grandpa died last week
And now he's buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked
But me I expected it to happen
I knew he'd lost control
When he built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes
Oh Mama can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the senator came down here
Showing ev'ryone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
An' me I nearly got busted
An' wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck
Oh Mama can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved it to him
Then I whispered  Not even you can hide
You see you're just like me
I hope you're satisfied 
Oh Mama can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said  Jump right in 
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
An' like a fool I mixed them
An' it strangled up my mind
An' now people just get uglier
An' I have no sense of time
Oh Mama can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
When Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
'Neath her Panamanian moon
An' I say  Aw come on now
You must know about my debutante 
An' she says  Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want 
Oh Mama can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
An' here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice
Oh Mama can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again										 
High water risin'-risin' night and day
All the gold and silver are bein' stolen away
Big Joe Turner lookin' east and west
From the dark room of his mind
He made it to Kansas City
Twelfth Street and Vine
Nothin' standing there
High water everywhere
High water risin' the shacks are slidin' down
Folks lose their possessions-folks are leaving town
Bertha Mason shook it-broke it
Then she hung it on a wall
Says  You're dancin' with whom they tell you to
Or you don't dance at all 
It's tough out there
High water everywhere
I got a cravin' love for blazing speed
Got a hopped-up Mustang Ford
Jump into the wagon love throw your panties on the board
I can write you poems make a strong man lose his mind
I'm no pig without a wig
I hope you treat me kind
Things are breakin' up out there
High water everywhere
High water risin' six inches 'bove my head
Coffins droppin' in the street
Like balloons made out of lead
Water pourin' into Vicksburg don't know what I'm goin' to do
 Don't reach out for me  she said
 Can't you see I'm drownin' too? 
It's rough out there
High water everywhere
Well George Lewis told the Englishman the Italian and the Jew
 You can't open your mind boys
To every conceivable point of view 
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five
Judge says to the High Sheriff
 I want him dead or alive
Either one I don't care 
High water everywhere
The Cuckoo is a pretty bird she warbles as she flies
I'm preachin' the Word of God
I'm puttin' out your eyes
I asked Fat Nancy for somethin' to eat she said  Take it off the shelf-
As great as you are a man
You'll never be greater than yourself 
I told her I didn't really care
High water everywhere
I'm gettin' up in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
Keeping away from the women
I'm givin' 'em lots of room
Thunder rolling over Clarkesdale everything is looking blue
I just can't be happy love
Unless you're happy too
It's bad out there
High water everywhere										 
They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
it was then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate
They walked along by the old canal
A little confused I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate
A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walkin' by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate
He woke up the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again how long must he wait
Once more for a simple twist of fate
People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin but I lost the ring
She was born in spring but I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate										 
Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'
Come senators congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside and it is ragin'
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'
The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'										 
Well I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps
Some of these women they just give me the creeps
I'm avoidin' the Southside the best I can
These memories I got they can strangle a man
Well I came ashore in the dead of the night
Lot of things can get in the way when you're tryin' to do what's right
You don't understand it-my feelings for you
You'd be honest with me if only you knew
I'm not sorry for nothin' I've done
I'm glad I fought
I only wish we'd won
The Siamese twins are comin' to town
People can't wait they are gathered around
When I left my home the sky split open wide
I never wanted to go back there
I'd rather have died
You don't understand it-my feelings for you
You'd be honest with me if only you knew
My woman got a face like a teddy bear
She's tossin' a baseball bat in the air
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword
I'm crashin' my car trunk first into the boards
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice
Well I'll sell it to ya at a reduced price
You don't understand it
my feelings for you
You'd be honest with me if only you knew
Some things are too terrible to be true
I won't come here no more if it bothers you
The Southern Pacific leaving me at nine forty-five
I'm having a hard time believin' some people were ever alive
I'm stark naked but I don't care
I'm going off into the woods I'm huntin' bare
You don't understand it-my feelings for you
Well you'd be honest with me if only you knew
I'm here to create the new imperial empire
I'm going to do whatever circumstances require
I care so much for you-didn't think that I could
I can't tell my heart that you're no good
Well my parents they warned me not to waste my years
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears
You don't understand it 
my feelings for you
Well you'd be honest with me if only you knew										 
Thunder on the mountain fires on the moon
There's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
Today's the day gonna grab my trombone and blow
Well there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go 
I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys couldn't keep from crying
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen I was living down the line
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be
I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee 
Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand
You brought me here now you're trying to run me away
The writing's on the wall come read it come see what it say 
Thunder on the mountain rolling like a drum
Gonna sleep over there that's where the music coming from
I don't need any guide I already know the way
Remember this I'm your servant both night and day 
The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
I'd like to try somethin' but I'm so far from town
The sun keeps shinin' and the North Wind keeps picking up speed
Gonna forget about myself for a while gonna go out and see what others need 
I've been sitting down studying the art of love
I think it will fit me like a glove
I want some real good woman to do just what I say
Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today 
Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing 
Gonna raise me an army some tough sons of bitches
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
I been to St  Herman's church and I've said my religious vows
I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows 
I got the porkchops she got the pie
She ain't no angel and neither am I
Shame on your greed shame on your wicked schemes
I'll say this I don't give a damn about your dreams 
Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
Mean old twister bearing down on me
All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town
Looks like something bad gonna happen better roll your airplane down 
Everybody's going and I want to go too
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
I did all I could and I did it right there and then
I've already confessed - no need to confess again 
Gonna make a lot of money gonna go up north
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
The hammer's on the table the pitchfork's on the shelf
For the love of God you ought to take pity on yourself										 
Stake my future on a hell of a past
Looks like tomorrow is coming on fast
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got
Seen better times but who has not?
Silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
When I come knocking don't throw me no bone
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
If you don't like it you can leave me alone
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
And charm the whistle off an evening train
I give what I got until I got no more
I take what I get until I even the score
You know I love you and furthermore
When it's time to go you got an open door
I can tell you fancy I can tell you plain
You give something up for everything you gain
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
Pay for your ticket and don't complain
One of these days and it won't be long
Going down in the valley and sing my song
I will sing it loud and sing it strong
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong
Silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know										 
You must leave now take what you need you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now Baby Blue
The highway is for gamblers better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky too is folding under you
And it's all over now Baby Blue
All your seasick sailors they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies are all going home
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is moving under you
And it's all over now Baby Blue
Leave your stepping stones behind something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match go start anew
And it's all over now Baby Blue										 
Well if you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
Well if you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast 
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
That's the way I remember her best 
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day
So if you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine										 
Well I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Yes I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Well you must tell me baby
How your head feels under somethin' like that
Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Well you look so pretty in it
Honey can I jump on it sometime?
Yes I just wanna see
If it's really that expensive kind
You know it balances on your head
Just like a mattress balances
On a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Well if you wanna see the sun rise
Honey I know where
We'll go out and see it sometime
We'll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt
Wrapped around my head
And you just sittin' there
In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Well I asked the doctor if I could see you
It's bad for your health he said
Yes I disobeyed his orders
I came to see you
But I found him there instead
You know I don't mind him cheatin' on me
But I sure wish he'd take that off his head
Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Well I see you got a new boyfriend
You know I never seen him before
Well I saw him
Makin' love to you
You forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But I know what he really loves you for
It's your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat										 
Spirit on the water 
Darkness on the face of the deep
I keep thinking about you baby 
I can't hardly sleep 
I'm traveling by land 
Traveling through the dawn of day
You're always on my mind 
I can't stay away 
I'd forgotten about you
Then you turned up again
I always knew
That we were meant to be more than friends 
When you are near 
It's just as plain as it can be
I'm wild about you gal 
You ought to be a fool about me 
Can't explain 
The sources of this hidden pain
You burned your way into my heart 
You got the key to my brain 
I've been trampling through mud
Praying to the powers above
I'm sweating blood
You got a face that begs for love 
Life without you 
Doesn't mean a thing to me
If I can't have you
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea
Sometimes I wonder 
Why you can't treat me right
You do good all day 
Then you do wrong all night 
When you're with me
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
What does it matter 
What price I pay 
They brag about your sugar 
Brag about it all over town
Put some sugar in my bowl
I feel like laying down
I'm pale as a ghost
Holding a blossom on a stem
You ever seen a ghost? No
But you have heard of them
I see you there
I'm blinded by the colors I see
I take good care
Of what belongs to me
I hear your name
Ringing up and down the line
I'm saying it plain
These ties are strong enough to bind
Your sweet voice
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
I got no choice
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind
I could live forever
With you perfectly
You don't ever
Have to make a fuss over me
From East to West
Ever since the world began
I only mean it for the best
I want to be with you any way I can
I been in a brawl
Now I'm feeling the wall
I'm going away baby
I won't be back 'til fall
High on the hill 
You can carry all my thoughts with you
You've numbed my will
This love could tear me in two
I wanna be with you in paradise
And it seems so unfair
I can't go to paradise no more
I killed a man back there
You think I'm over the hill
You think I'm past my prime
Let me see what you got
We can have a whoppin' good time										 
What's the matter with me
I don't have much to say
Daylight sneakin' through the window
And I'm still in this all-night cafe
Walkin' to and fro beneath the moon
Out to where the trucks are rollin' slow
To sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow
Wish I was back in the city
Instead of this old bank of sand
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
And the one I love so close at hand
If I had wings and I could fly
I know where I would go
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly
And watch the river flow
People disagreeing on all just about everything yeah
Makes you stop and all wonder why
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
Who just couldn't help but cry
Oh this ol' river keeps on rollin' though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does I'll just sit here
And watch the river flow
People disagreeing everywhere you look
Makes you wanna stop and read a book
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
That was really shook
But this ol' river keeps on rollin' though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does I'll just sit here
And watch the river flow
Watch the river flow
Watchin' the river flow
Watchin' the river flow
But I'll sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow										 
May God bless and keep you always
May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever young
Forever young forever young
May you stay forever young
May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young
Forever young forever young
May you stay forever young
May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
Forever young forever young
May you stay forever young										 
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist she don't look back
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist she don't look back
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
And paint the daytime black
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
Down upon your knees
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She's nobody's child
The Law can't touch her at all
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks
She's a hypnotist collector
You are a walking antique
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween give her a trumpet
And for Christmas buy her a drum										 
They say ev'rything can be replaced
Yet ev'ry distance is not near
So I remember ev'ry face
Of ev'ry man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released
They say ev'ry man needs protection
They say ev'ry man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released										 
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
They're throwing knives into the tree
Two big bags of dead man's bones
Got their noses to the grindstones
Living in the Land of Nod
Trustin' their fate to the Hands of God
They pass by so silently
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Well they're going to the country they're gonna retire
They're taking a street car named Desire
Looking in the window at the pecan pie
Lot of things they'd like they would never buy
Neither one gonna turn and run
They're making a voyage to the sun
 His Master's voice is calling me 
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum
All that and more and then some
They walk among the stately trees
They know the secrets of the breeze
Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee
 Your presence is obnoxious to me 
They're like babies sittin' on a woman's knee
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Well the rain beating down on my window pane
I got love for you and it's all in vain
Brains in the pot they're beginning to boil
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil
Tweedle-dee Dee he's on his hands and his knees
Saying  Throw me somethin' Mister please 
 What's good for you is good for me 
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
Well they're living in a happy harmony
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
They're one day older and a dollar short
They've got a parade permit and a police escort
They're lying low and they're makin' hay
They seem determined to go all the way
They run a brick-and-tile company
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Well a childish dream is a deathless need
And a noble truth is a sacred dream
My pretty baby she's lookin' around
She's wearin' a multi-thousand dollar gown
Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown sorry old man
Tweedle-dee Dum he'll stab you where you stand
 I've had too much of your company 
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee										 
They're selling postcards of the hanging
They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row
Cinderella she seems so easy
 It takes one to know one  she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo he's moaning
 You Belong to Me I Believe 
And someone says  You're in the wrong place my friend
You better leave 
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row
Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row
Now Ophelia she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row
Einstein disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend a jealous monk
He looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row
Dr  Filth he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
 Have Mercy on His Soul 
They all play on pennywhistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row
Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
They're spoonfeeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
 Get Outa Here If You Don't Know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row 
Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row
Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody's shouting
 Which Side Are You On? 
And Ezra Pound and T  S  Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row
Yes I received your letter yesterday
(About the time the doorknob broke)
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes I know them they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row										 
Mama take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark too dark for me to see
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Mama put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door										 
Oh where have you been my blue-eyed son?
Oh where have you been my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard and it's a hard it's a hard and it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh what did you see my blue-eyed son?
Oh what did you see my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard and it's a hard it's a hard it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
And what did you hear my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder it roared out a warnin'
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
Heard one person starve I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard and it's a hard it's a hard it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh who did you meet my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
And it's a hard it's a hard it's a hard it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh what'll you do now my blue-eyed son?
Oh what'll you do now my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color where none is the number
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'
And it's a hard it's a hard it's a hard it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall										 
Close your eyes close the door
You don't have to worry anymore
I'll be your baby tonight
Shut the light shut the shade
You don't have to be afraid
I'll be your baby tonight
Well that mockingbird's gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
That big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But we're gonna let it
You won't regret it
Kick your shoes off do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
I'll be your baby tonight										 
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around
Well I'm all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
My love for her is taking such a long time to die
I'm waist deep waist deep in the mist
It's almost like almost like I don't exist
I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
The walls of pride are high and wide
Can't see over to the other side
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away
One look at you and I'm out of control
Like the universe has swallowed me whole
I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
There's too many people too many to recall
I thought some of 'm were friends of mine I was wrong about 'm all
Well the road is rocky and the hillside's mud
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
I found my world found my world in you
But your love just hasn't proved true
I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Oh the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds
Reality has always had too many heads
Some things last longer than you think they will
There are some kind of things you can never kill
It's you and you only I been thinking about
But you can't see in and it's hard lookin' out
I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Well the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank
The whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank
I tried to love and protect you because I cared
I'm gonna remember forever the joy that we shared
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee
You have no idea what you do to me
I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

Might like to wear cotton might like to wear silk
Might like to drink whiskey might like to drink milk
You might like to eat caviar you might like to eat bread
You may be sleeping on the floor sleeping in a king-sized bed
But you're gonna have to serve somebody yes indeed
You're gonna have to serve somebody
Well it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you're gonna have to serve somebody
You may call me Terry you may call me Timmy
You may call me Bobby you may call me Zimmy
You may call me R J  you may call me Ray
You may call me anything but no matter what you say
You're gonna have to serve somebody yes indeed
You're gonna have to serve somebody
Well it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you're gonna have to serve somebody										 
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen
Stay lady stay stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay lady stay stay while the night is still ahead										 
I love you pretty baby 
You're the only love I've ever known
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throne
Beyond here lies nothin'
Nothin' we can call our own
I'm movin' after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what to do without it
Without this love that we call ours
Beyond here lies nothin'
Nothin' but the moon and stars
Down every street there's a window
And every window made of glass
We'll keep on lovin' pretty baby
For as long as love will last
Beyond here lies nothin'
But the mountains of the past
My ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head
Beyond here lies nothin'
Nothin' done and nothin' said										 
'Twas in another lifetime one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form
 Come in  she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm 
And if I pass this way again you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm
 Come in  she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm 
Not a word was spoke between us there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
 Come in  she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm 
I was burned out from exhaustion buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile ravaged in the corn
 Come in  she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm 
Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
 Come in  she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm 
Now there's a wall between us somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
 Come in  she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm 
Well the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker he blows a futile horn
 Come in  she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm 
I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question man is it hopeless and forlorn?
 Come in  she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm 
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation an' they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
 Come in  she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm 
Well I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
Come in  she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm 										 
Come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Shall pass as your senses will rise
The flowers of the city
Though breathlike
Get deathlike at times
And there's no use in tryin'
T' deal with the dyin'
Though I cannot explain that in lines
Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be under the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I'm in
But it grieves my heart love
To see you tryin' to be a part of
A world that just don't exist
It's all just a dream babe
A vacuum a scheme babe
That sucks you into feelin' like this
I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
By worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between stayin' and returnin'
On back to the South
You've been fooled into thinking
That the finishin' end is at hand
Yet there's no one to beat you
No one t' defeat you
'Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad
I've heard you say many times
That you're better 'n no one
And no one is better 'n you
If you really believe that
You know you got
Nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends
Your sorrow does stem
That hype you and type you
Making you feel
That you must be exactly like them
I'd forever talk to you
But soon my words
They would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there is no help I can bring
Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday maybe
Who knows baby
I'll come and be cryin' to you										 
My love she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true like ice like fire
People carry roses
Make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her
In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
Some speak of the future
My love she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all
The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge
The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows cold and rainy
My love she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing										 
You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning
You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that's winning
You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt
Why then don't you show it
You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it
I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You're in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don't know to begin with
You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say  How are you?   Good luck 
But you don't mean it
When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once
And scream it
No I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I'd rob them
And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem
I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is
To see you										 
I can't understand
She let go of my hand
An' left me here facing the wall
I'd sure like t' know
Why she did go
But I can't get close t' her at all
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now mornin's clear
It's like I ain't here
She just acts like we never have met
It's all new t' me
Like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
Yet it's hard t' think on
That she's the same one
That last night I was with
From darkness dreams're deserted
Am I still dreamin' yet?
I wish she'd unlock
Her voice once an' talk
'Stead of acting like we never have met
If she ain't feelin' well
Then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back t' my face?
Without any doubt
She seems too far out
For me t' return t' her chase
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don't
An' evidently she won't
She just acts like we never have met
If I didn't have t' guess
I'd gladly confess
T' anything I might've tried
If I was with 'er too long
Or have done something wrong
I wish she'd tell me what it is I'll run an' hide
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed
For she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met
I'm leavin' today
I'll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to
I can be just like you
An' pretend that we never have touched
An' if anybody asks me
 Is it easy to forget? 
I'll say  It's easily done
You just pick anyone
An' pretend that you never have met!

You say you love me
And you're thinkin' of me
But you know you could be wrong
You say you told me
That you wanna hold me
But you know you're not that strong
I just can't do what I done before
I just can't beg you anymore
I'm gonna let you pass
And I'll go last
Then time will tell just who fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
You say you disturb me
And you don't deserve me
But you know sometimes you lie
You say you're shakin'
And you're always achin'
But you know how hard you try
Sometimes it gets so hard to care
It can't be this way ev'rywhere
And I'm gonna let you pass
Yes and I'll go last
Then time will tell just who fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
The judge he holds a grudge
He's gonna call on you
But he's badly built
And he walks on stilts
Watch out he don't fall on you
You say you're sorry
For tellin' stories
That you know I believe are true
You say ya got some
Other kinda lover
And yes I believe you do
You say my kisses are not like his
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is
I'm just gonna let you pass
Yes and I'll go last
Then time will tell who fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine										  
The cat's in the well the wolf is looking down
The cat's in the well the wolf is looking down
He got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground
The cat's in the well the gentle lady is asleep
Cat's in the well the gentle lady is asleep
She ain't hearing a thing the silence is a-stickin' her deep
The cat's in the well and grief is showing its face
The world's being slaughtered and it's such a bloody disgrace
The cat's in the well the horse is going bumpety bump
The cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety bump
Back alley Sally is doing the American jump
The cat's in the well and Papa is reading the news
His hair's falling out and all of his daughters need shoes
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull
The night is so long and the table is oh so full
The cat's in the well and the servant is at the door
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war
The cat's in the well the leaves are starting to fall
The cat's in the well leaves are starting to fall
Goodnight my love may the Lord have mercy on us all										 
Oh I'm sailin' away my own true love
I'm sailin' away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I'll be landing?
No there's nothin' you can send me my own true love
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean
Oh but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona
Oh but if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'
That I might be gone a long time
And it's only that I'm askin'
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passin'
Oh how can how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I want from you today
I would want again tomorrow
I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'
Well if you my love must think that-a-way
I'm sure your mind is roamin'
I'm sure your heart is not with me
But with the country to where you're goin'
So take heed take heed of the western wind
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes there's something you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather										 
William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
William Zanzinger who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering and his tongue it was snarling
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn't even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
And he spoke through his cloak most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Oh but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now's the time for your tears										 
Crickets are chirpin' the water is high
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hangin' dry
Window wide open African trees
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
Not a word of goodbye not even a note
She gone with the man
In the long black coat
Somebody seen him hanging around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance he had a face like a mask
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote
There was dust on the man
In the long black coat
Preacher was a talkin' there's a sermon he gave
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When it's you who must keep it satisfied
It ain't easy to swallow it sticks in the throat
She gave her heart to the man
In the long black coat
There are no mistakes in life some people say
It is true sometimes you can see it that way
But people don't live or die people just float
She went with the man
In the long black coat
There's smoke on the water it's been there since June
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
Somebody is out there beating a dead horse
She never said nothing there was nothing she wrote
She gone with the man
In the long black coat										 
Broken lines broken strings
Broken threads broken springs
Broken idols broken heads
People sleeping in broken beds
Ain't no use jiving
Ain't no use joking
Everything is broken
Broken bottles broken plates
Broken switches broken gates
Broken dishes broken parts
Streets are filled with broken hearts
Broken words never meant to be spoken
Everything is broken
Seem like every time you stop and turn around
Something else just hit the ground
Broken cutters broken saws
Broken buckles broken laws
Broken bodies broken bones
Broken voices on broken phones
Take a deep breath feel like you're chokin'
Everything is broken
Every time you leave and go off someplace
Things fall to pieces in my face
Broken hands on broken ploughs
Broken treaties broken vows
Broken pipes broken tools
People bending broken rules
Hound dog howling bullfrog croaking
Everything is broken										   
There's an evenin' haze settlin' over the town
Starlight by the edge of the creek
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
Money's gettin' shallow and weak
The place I love best is a sweet memory
It's a new path that we trod
They say low wages are a reality
If we want to compete abroad 
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Come sit down on my knee
You are dearer to me than myself
As you yourself can see
I'm listenin' to the steel rails hum
Got both eyes tight shut
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
Creeping it's way into my gut 
Meet me at the bottom don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
Now I'm sailin' on back ready for the long haul
Tossed by the winds and the seas
I'll drag 'em all down to hell and I'll stand 'em at the wall
I'll sell 'em to their enemies
I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometimes no one wants what we got
Sometimes you can't give it away 
Now the place is ringed with countless foes
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
No man no woman knows 
The hour that sorrow will come
In the dark I hear the night birds call
I can hear a lover's breath
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
Sleep is like a temporary death
Meet me at the bottom don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
Well they burned my barn they stole my horse
I can't save a dime
I got to be careful I don't want to be forced
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
How I wish you were here to see 
Tell me now am I wrong in thinking
That you have forgotten me? 
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I'll remember always
Old memories of you to me have clung
You've wounded me with words
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
It's all true everything you have heard 
Meet me at the bottom don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
In you my friend I find no blame
Wanna look in my eyes please do
No one can ever claim
That I took up arms against you
All across the peaceful sacred fields
They will lay you low
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
I say it so it must be so 
Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
Gonna give you another chance
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never worked a day in their life
Don't know what work even means 
Meet me at the bottom don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues										 
do you know where we're headin'?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Seems like I been down this way before
Is there any truth in that?
do you know where she is hidin'?
How long are we gonna be ridin'?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Will there be any comfort there senor?
There's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck
There's an iron cross still hangin' down from around her neck
There's a marchin' band still playin' in that vacant lot
Where she held me in her arms one time and said  Forget me not 
Senor senor I can see that painted wagon
I can smell the tail of the dragon
Can't stand the suspense anymore
Can you tell me who to contact here senor?
Well the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
Said  Son this ain't a dream no more it's the real thing 
Senor senor you know their hearts is as hard as leather
Well give me a minute let me get it together
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor
I'm ready when you are senor
Senor senor let's disconnect these cables
Overturn these tables
This place don't make sense to me no more
Can you tell me what we're waiting for senor?										 
Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
 We'll meet on edges soon  said I
Proud 'neath heated brow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
 Rip down all hate  I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull  I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep somehow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
Girls' faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of though somehow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
 Equality  I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
Yes my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad I define these terms
Quite clear no doubt somehow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now										 
They ask me how I feel
And if my love is real
And how I know I'll make it through
And they they look at me and frown
They'd like to drive me from this town
They don't want me around
'Cause I believe in you
They show me to the door
They say don't come back no more
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And I walk out on my own
A thousand miles from home
But I don't feel alone
'Cause I believe in you
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
I believe in you even though we be apart
I believe in you even on the morning after
Oh when the dawn is nearing
Oh when the night is disappearing
Oh this feeling is still here in my heart
Don't let me drift too far
Keep me where you are
Where I will always be renewed
And that which you've given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
And no matter what they say
I believe in you
I believe in you when winter turn to summer
I believe in you when white turn to black
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered
Oh though the earth may shake me
Oh though my friends forsake me
Oh even that couldn't make me go back
Don't let me change my heart
Keep me set apart
From all the plans they do pursue
And I I don't mind the pain
Don't mind the driving rain
I know I will sustain
'Cause I believe in you										 
Oh help me in my weakness 
I heard the drifter say
As they carried him from the courtroom
And were taking him away
 My trip hasn't been a pleasant one
And my time it isn't long
And I still do not know
What it was that I've done wrong 
Well the judge he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
You fail to understand  he said
Why must you even try? 
Outside the crowd was stirring
You could hear it from the door
Inside the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more
Oh stop that cursed jury 
Cried the attendant and the nurse
The trial was bad enough
But this is ten times worse
Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray
The drifter did escape										   
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
And it's Eastertime too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess outta you
Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend my doctor
Won't even say what it is I've got
Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon
Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick up one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man they expect the same
Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who
Just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking just like a ghost
I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to call my bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough										 
Well I thought that the rain would cool things down
But it looks like it don't
I'd like to get you to change your mind
But it looks like you won't
From now on I'll be busy
Ain't goin' nowhere fast
I'm just glad it's over
And I'm seeing the real you at last
Well didn't I risk my neck for you
Didn't I take chances?
Didn't I rise above it all for you
The most unfortunate circumstances?
Well I have had some rotten nights
Didn't think that they would pass
I'm just thankful and grateful
To be seeing the real you at last
I'm hungry and I'm irritable
And I'm tired of this bag of tricks
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
That you could not fix
Well I sailed through the storm
Strapped to the mast
But the time has come
And I'm seeing the real you at last
When I met you baby
You didn't show no visible scars
You could ride like Annie Oakley
You could shoot like Belle Starr
Well I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble
Trouble always comes to pass
But all I care about now
Is that I'm seeing the real you at last
Well I'm gonna quit this baby talk now
I guess I should have known
I got troubles I think maybe you got troubles
I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone
Whatever you gonna do
Please do it fast
I'm still trying to get used to
Seeing the real you at last										 
What good am I if I'm like all the rest
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry
What good am I?
What good am I if I know and don't do
If I see and don't say if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky
What good am I?
What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try
What good am I?
What good am I then to others and me
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
What good am I?										 
Down the street the dogs are barkin'
And the day is a-gettin' dark
As the night comes in a-fallin'
The dogs'll lose their bark
An' the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
For I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind
From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes they start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
An' I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I'm one too many mornings
An' a thousand miles behind
It's a restless hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good
When ev'rything I'm a-sayin'
You can say it just as good 
You're right from your side
I'm right from mine
We're both just one too many mornings
An' a thousand miles behind										 
Forgetful heart
Lost your power of recall 
Every little detail
You don't remember at all
The times we knew
Who would remember better then you
Forgetful heart
We laughed and had a good time you and I
It's been so long
Now you're content to let the days go by
When you were there
You were the answer to my prayer
Forgetful heart
We loved with all the love that life can give
What can I say
Without you it's so hard to live  
Can't take much more
Why can't we love like we did before
Forgetful heart
Like a walking shadow in my brain
All night long
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
The door has closed forevermore 
If indeed there ever was a door										  
I'll remember you
When I've forgotten all the rest
You to me were true
You to me were the best
When there is no more
You cut to the core
Quicker than anyone I knew
When I'm all alone
In the great unknown
I'll remember you
I'll remember you
At the end of the trail
I had so much left to do
I had so little time to fail
There's some people that
You don't forget
Even though you've only seen 'm one time or two
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade
I'll remember you
Didn't I didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair?
I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood
It was you who came right through
It was you who understood
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to
In the end
My dear sweet friend
I'll remember you										 
Seen the arrow on the doorpost
Saying  This land is condemned
All the way from New Orleans
To Jerusalem 
I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Well I heard that hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes a-moaning
Hear them
I'll undress you 'cause you're tired
Cover you as you desire
When you fall asleep inside my arms
May not have the fancy things
But I'll give you everything
You could ever want it's in my arms So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
I will be right by your side If I can't find the cure I'll
I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you know I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure) Rub your feet your hands your legs
Let me take care of it babe
Close your eyes I'll sing your favorite song
I wrote you this lullaby
Hush now baby don't you cry
Anything you want could not be wrong So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
I will be right by your side If I can't find the cure I'll
I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you know I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure) I'll fix you with my love
(I'll fix you with my love-lo-love)
I'll fix you with my love
(I'll fix you with my love-lo-love) If I can't find the cure I'll
I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you know I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure)
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure) I'll fix you with my love

Last night when we were alone
You threw your arms up
Baby you gave up you gave up I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke? I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless so speechless I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
All my bubble dreams bubble dreams I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye And I know that it's complicated
But I'm a loser in love
So baby raise a glass to mend
All the broken hearts

Won't even sing along
I'll never love again How how how so speechless
You left me speechless so speechless baby Will you ever talk again?
Oh boy why you so speechless?
You've left me speechless so speechless Some men may follow me
But you choose death and company

Hurts more than I can say (And it was kind of dirty)
Oh my (And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here! (It was kind of nasty aah!)
Help me here! (It was kind of trashy)
Cause I can't help my mind from going there! 
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you 
Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things 
Damn you were in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 
We could be caught
We're both convicted criminals of thought
Let's white glove the bed
Help me here!
Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!

Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over rubber spinnin'
Big swig toss another beer can
Too lit tonight prayin'
On the moonlight Every john is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne Baby let's get high John Wayne
Baby let's get high John Wayne Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip so hard eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up 'cause the man's on a mission
One two ya the gears are shiftin'
He called I cried we broke
Racin' through the moonlight Every john is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne Baby let's get high John Wayne
Baby let's get high John Wayne So I go to the eye
Of the storm
Just to feel your love
Knock me over
Here I go
Into our love storm Baby let's get high John Wayne
Baby let's get high John Wayne Last night
(Our lovers quarrel)
I was thinking about you
(More than I can say)
And it was kind of dirty
(All night)
And the way that you looked at me
(Help me here)
It was kind of nasty
(Help me here)
It was kind of trashy
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought ('cause I'm broken)
Let's white (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kinda nasty) Help me here
'Cause I feel so trashy
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our head Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
And I lay in bed I touch myself and I think of you Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams You could turn a stone
Or the color of a man petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him I think of him I can't believe I'm telling you this but
I've had a couple of drinks and oh my god Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn you were in my sex dreams

And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears and all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright Just give in don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me Just know when that glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time So happy I could die be your best friend
Yeah I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds we'll be higher than ever So happy I could die and it's alright
I am as vain as I allow I do my hair
I gloss my eyes I touch myself all through the night
And when something falls out of place
I take my time I put it back
I touch myself 'til I'm on track Just give in don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me Just know when that glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time So happy I could die be your best friend

So happy I could die and it's alright I came down the mountain
Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way saying forever too fast
Don't get mad can't blame a tramp
For something he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as good as good as good as gold Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothing more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece from Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for getting what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink and throws her off
I get on my knees and beg you Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as good as good as good as gold
Good as good as good as good as gold I can carry you but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith but I don't know oh Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as good as good as good as gold
Good as good as good as good as gold

And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well 'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer Our love his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Just cut it out Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtains finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
Go on and take a bow Grab your clothes and get gone
Before the sprinklers come on
Talkin' 'bout Girl I love you you're the one
This just looks like a re-run
What else is on? And don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtains finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
Go on and take a bow And the award for the best liar goes to you
For makin' me believe
That you could be
Faithful to me
Let's hear your speech out
Oh How 'bout a round of applause?
Standin' ovation But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtains finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
Go on and take a bow But it's over now All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot headed believer
I threw my hands in the air I said show me something
He said if you dare come a little closer Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay Oh the reason I hold on
Oh 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is caving 
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay stay
I want you to stay oh Na na na come on
Come on na na na na Feels so good being bad
There's no way I'm turning back
Now the pain is for pleasure
'Cause nothing can measure Love is great love is fine
Out the box out of line
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more 
'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air I don't care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air I don't care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me Na na na come on come on come on
I like it like it come on come on come on
I like it like it Love is great love is fine
Out the box out of line
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more 
'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air I don't care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me Na na na come on come on come on
I like it like it come on come on come on
I like it like it come on come on come on

Oh you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say ah ah ah
I like it like it 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air I don't care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air I don't care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me Na na na come on come on come on
I like it like it come on come on come on
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories This morning you wake a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby speak softly tell me how awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby without you I'm nothing I'm so lost hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am but that you'll always love me
Then after that shove me in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each others backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together we move mountains let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice yeah but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times I'm startin' to lose count
But together we'll live forever we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy we're nuts but I refused counseling
This house is too huge if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my fuckin' mind without you I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I left the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes So shine bright tonight you and I

We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
It's like you're screaming and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed
That someone could be that important
That without them you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless; like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine mine mine) We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Calm yourself he says to me
If you play you play the key
Take the gun and count to three
I'm sweating now I'm moving slow
No time to think my turn to go And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving no
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger Say a prayer to yourself
He says close your eyes
Sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here means he's never lost And you can see my heart beating
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life And you can see my heart beating
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving no!
I know that I must pass this test
And you can see my heart beating
Oh you can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving no!
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh that's all I want Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin' I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back I'm 'bout to spaz I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh that's all I want And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' How could I be so selfish?
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' How could I be so reckless?
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me

How to make you feel like a man Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world Chest to chest nose to nose
Palm to palm we were always just that close
Wrist to wrist toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us? In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me my California king Eye to eye cheek to cheek
Side by side you were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm dusk to dawn with the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us? In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me my California king Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me my California king My California king
My California king In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me my California king That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? But you won't let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget 
Can't remember what you did You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you And I hate how much I love you boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so
And you completely know the power that you have
The only one makes me laugh Sad and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I love you beyond a reason why
And it just ain't right And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you boy
I can't stand how much I need ya
And I hate how much I love you boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so And I hate that I love you so so Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond Find light in the beautiful sea I choose to be happy
You and I you and I we're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see a vision of ecstasy

When we first met I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
And now I feel like Oh you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed It's like I checked into rehab
And baby you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
And baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease Damn ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'd do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way than I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
It gotta go I gotta wean myself off of you And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the way you hurt me do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
'Cause now I feel like Oh you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave

everything is restless in my heart
I hate the way this feels
suddenly I'm scared to be apart.
The days are dark when you're not around
the air is getting hard to breathe.
I wish that you would just put me down
I wish that I could go to sleep. Loving you is suicide
I Don't know should I go or should I stay?
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
But I heard you say you loved me.
That's the part I can't forget
and I wish that you'd come save me
cause' I'm standing over the edge. I should let you go
tell myself the things I need to hear
but my brain is wired wrong.
That's why i'm loving you when you're not here.
Feels like I drown in your every word
and every breath that's in between.
Somehow you got me where it really hurts
And it's killing every part of me. Loving you is suicide.
I don't know should I go or should I stay.
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
But I heard you say you loved me
that's the part I can't forget.
And I wish that you'd come save me boy
cause I'm standing over the edge. loving you is suicide
and my world's about to break
And I had as much as I can take
and love is a long way down. Loving you is suicide
and it's getting harder everyday.
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
And I'm way past every moment
but I'm still determined to fight
and I know it's taking all my strength
to keep emotion alive.
Loving you is suicide Te amo te amo she say's to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra she takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes it's over 
Then she said Te amo then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no she cried Te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away but let me go
My soul is awry and without asking why
I said Te amo wish somebody would tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you Te amo te amo she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand I got no choice uhh
Pulled me out on the beach danced in the water I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over 
Then she said Te amo then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no she cried Te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away but let me go
My soul is awry and without asking why
I said Te amo wish somebody would tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you Yes we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
I move under the light because I understand
That we all need love and I'm not afraid
I feel the love but I don't feel that way 
Then she said Te amo then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no she cried Te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away but let me go
My soul is awry and without asking why
I said Te amo wish somebody would tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you I love you I love you

Nothing heard nothing said

All my life on my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I'm going insane
Yeah It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort Throw on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind is in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight
Your mind is in Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they talkin' to me
Disconnectin' your call
Your phone don't even ring
I gotta get out
Or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
I feel like a monster Throw on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind is in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Am I scaring you tonight
Your mind is in Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Release me from this curse I'm in
I've been trying to maintain
But I'm struggling
You can't go go go

Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind is in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Am I scaring you tonight
Your mind is in Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Nothing but a tear that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected

But I'm in love can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction hoping that the message goes Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they heard you you wouldn't find out
Just say now I'm coming right now to be close to you Said you let it go you kept it
Working hard to perfect it

Would you let it go? No you don't need my protection
But I'm in love can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction hoping that the message goes Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they heard you you wouldn't find out
If you let me I'd be there by now

I shouldn't be crying tears were for the weak
The days I'm stronger know what so I say

Whatever it is it's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream What now? I just can't figure it out

And I just wanna scream What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Please tell me

this is special what's happenin' to all my
All my all my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful
For the life you got you know what I'm sayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
And start being thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl You're gonna be a shinin' star
In fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you'll see you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows just who ya are
So live your life
You steady chasin' that paper just live your life
Ain't got no time for no haters just live your life
No tellin' where it'll take ya just live your life
'Cause I'm a paper chaser just livin' my life
Hey never mind what haters say
Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazin' they ungrateful
After all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way
I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay'
You know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience
But they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away You're gonna be a shining star
In fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you'll see you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows just who ya are
So live your life
You steady chasin' that paper just live your life
Ain't got no time for no haters just live your life
No tellin' where it'll take ya just live your life
'Cause I'm a paper chaser just livin' my life
my life I'm the opposite of moderate
Immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit
Impartial to the politics
Articulate
But still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems
With their record sales just holler TIP
If that don't work and all else fails
Then turn around and follow TIP
I got love for the game
But ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'
Back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from who you know
What you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches
'Cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we? You're gonna be a shinin' star
In fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you'll see you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows just who ya are
So live your life 
You steady chasin' that paper just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser just livin' my life
Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror and keep on shining
Until the game ends 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life my life

So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up off sizz' and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind You take me higher higher than I've ever been babe
Just come over let's pour a drink babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk and still with a full ash tray
With a little bit too much to say Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now A drug and a dream
We lost connection oh come back to me
So I can feel alive again
Soul and body try to mend It's pulling me apart this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again to be in love again to be in love again Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now It's pulling me apart this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again to be in love again to be in love again Be in love again 
I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing My mind is gone I'm spinning round
And deep inside my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip what's happening
I stray from love this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry Did it happen when we first kissed?
Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart My mind is gone I'm spinning round
And deep inside my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip what's happening
I stray from love this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry How did I get here with you I'll never know?
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

Why are we Strangers when Our love is strong
Why carry on without me Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small

And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you baby I make-believe
That you are here
It's the only way
That I see clear
What have I done
You seem to move on easy Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you baby I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you baby You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close I move away I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow
There's things about me you just have to know Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right be with you day and night Baby all I need is time I don't wanna be so shy
Every time that I'm alone I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow
There's things about me you just have to know Sometimes I run

It's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I I'm stronger Stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
Now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more (no more)
I I'm stronger Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind whoa Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind whoa Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind whoa Baby I'm so into you
You've got that something what can I do
Baby you spin me around oh
The earth is movin' but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin' it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before 
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited I'm in too deep
Crazy but it feels alright
Baby thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue oh
That I'm not wastin'
My feelins on you
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
Chorus
Crazy I just can't sleep
I'm so excited I'm in too deep
Crazy but it feels alright
Every day and every night
Chorus Hey over there
Please forgive me
If I'm comin' on too strong
Hate to stare
But you're winnin'
And they're playin' my favorite song
So come here
A little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear
A little question
Wanna know just how you feel If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? Hey you might think
That I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be
Little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark
In between us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more
Wanna see it
So I'm askin' you tonight If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? If I said I want your body
Would you hold it against me?
Yeah uh-huh oh Give me somethin' good
Don't wanna wait
I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out Alright
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? I used to think
I had the answers to everything
But now I know
That life doesn't always
Go my way yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl There is no need to protect me
It's time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find
Her way (I'm not a girl)
I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe
(Not yet a woman)
I'm just tryin' to find the woman in me yeah
(All I need is time) all I need is time
(A moment that is mine) that's mine
While I'm in between I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time (is all I need)

Loneliness up ahead emptiness behind
Where do I go? And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you now still I miss you somehow From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart Baby I said
Please stay give our love a chance for one more day
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about But you put a dart through my dreams
Through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here now From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart Never look back we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so? For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand?
I'm so glad we're at the same place
At the same time it's over now

Those lips and your brown eyes
And the sexy hair

You're going to have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't want to be so damn protected There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
God I need some answers What am I to do with my life?
How am I supposed to know what's right?
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected I'll tell them what I like what I want what I don't
But every time I do I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
I can't believe what I hear about the world I realize
I'm overprotected There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
God I need some answers What am I to do with my life?
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected I need time
I need space
I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I what what what I'm going to
Do about my destiny
I say no no nobody's telling me just
What what what I wanna do do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me (Action!) What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I what what what I'm going to
Do about my destiny
I say no no nobody's telling me just
What what what I wanna do do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me What am I to do with my life?
How am I supposed to know what's right?
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected There's a girl in the mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes
When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken easily 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do If I could
I would tell her
Not to be afraid
The pain that she's feeling The sense of loneliness will fade
So dry your tears and rest assured
Love will find you like before
When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying in tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do I can't believe it's what I see
That the girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Is me I can't believe what I see
The girl in my mirror is me
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something

Lost in the world out of me myself and I
Was lonely then like an alien

Ooh that was then like an alien But the stars in the sky look like home take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone Crossed through the universe to get where you are
Travel the night riding on a shooting star
Was lonely then like an alien
Had to get used to the world I was on
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belong
Ooh That was then like an alien But the stars in the sky look like home take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone But the stars in the sky look like home take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone - not alone not alone not alone) Ya!

Don't go to strangers darling come to me Tonight you're mine completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs

Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow

Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
I go back to us I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to Black
I go back to
I go back to We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to black You should be stronger than me
You've been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always want to talk it through I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do stroke my hair
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my lady boy You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
You always want to talk it through I'm okay
I always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do are you gay?
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my lady boy He said the respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learn
I said You don't know what love is get a grip
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just want to grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime
I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my lady boy You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me They tried to make me go to rehab

And I look across the water
And I think of all the things what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Did you have to go to jail
Put your house up for sale did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
And are you shopping anywhere
Changed the color of your hair are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
You were dodging all the time are you still dizzy? 'Cause since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? 
Valerie Why don't come over Valerie? Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say Why did you do it with him today?
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Sweet reunion Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
Yeah ya know that I'm no good All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we knew
And this regret I got accustomed to
Once it was so right
When we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
You don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away I have no capacity He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own I don't understand
Why do I stress the man
When there's so many bigger things at hand?
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you
And perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play my self again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck my self in the head with stupid men He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own I wish I could sing no regrets
And no emotional debt
'Cause as we kissed goodbye the sun sets
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze
That only lovers see He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way
My blue shade
My tears dry on their own Whoa he walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way
My deep shade
My tears dry on their own He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your way
My deep shade
My tears dry For you I was the flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is losing game One I wished I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game It's okay in the day
I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself I do a one-eighty
I stay up clean the house
At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears 'soon as the sun sets He's fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone If I was my heart
I'd rather be restless
The second I stop the sleep catches up
And I'm breathless
'Cause this ache in my chest
As my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him (before him I)
It's all I can do to assure him (assure him)
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me we bathe under blue light He's fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone Tonight you're mine completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow There I go there I go there I go there I go
Pretty baby you are the soul snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time your near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me
Crazy music music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything baby just let me get next to you So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky how I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here don't have no fear
Oh is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love So tell me why stop to think about this weather my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh when we are one I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
Now if there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you
And get a release from this awful misery What is all this talk about loving me my sweet
I am not afraid not anymore not like before
Don't you understand me now baby please
Pull yourself together do it soon
My soul's on fire come on and take
I'll be what you make me my darling Oh baby you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land Maybe there we can find
A good place to use a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never known what love's about
James Moody would you come on hit me
You can blow now if you want to I'm through Nobody stands in between me and my man
It's me and Mr. Jones What kind of fuckery is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig
And thought I didn't love you when I did
Can't believe you played me out like that No you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss 
You can't keep lying to yourself like this 
Can't believe you played yourself like this Ruler's one thing but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones What kind of fuckery are we?
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me 
I might let you make it up to me
Who's playing Saturday? What kind of fuckery are you?
'Side from Sammy you're my best black Jew
But I could swear that we were through 
I still want to wonder 'bout the things you do Mr. Destiny nine and fourteen
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
Yeah There's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
Seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek
A certain lad
I've had in mind Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think
Of with regret I'd like
To add his initial
To my monogram
Tell me
Where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb? There's a somebody
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns
Out to be
Someone to watch over me I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one
Who'll watch over me Although he may
Not be the man some
Girls think
Of as handsome
To my heart
He carries the key Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh how I need
Someone to watch over me Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me When will we get
The time to be
Just friends? It's never safe for us
Not even in the evening
'Cause I've been drinking
Not in the morning
When your shit works
It's always dangerous
When everybody's sleeping
And I've been thinking
Can we be alone?
Can we be alone? When will we get
The time to be
Just friends?
When will we get
The time to be
Just friends? And no I'm not ashamed
But the guilt will kill you
If she don't first
I'll never love you like her
Thought we need to find a time
To just do this shit together
'Fore it gets worse
I want to touch you
But that just hurts When will we get
The time to be
Just just friends?
When will we get
The time to be
Just friends just friends? When will we get
The time to be
Just friends just friends?

All my loving darling I'll be true
All my loving all my loving
Ooh all my loving all my loving I will send to you Her name is Cherry we've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down And you're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name And when I'm lonely Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back you're stubborn as a mule Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar Wish I could say it breaks my heart
Like you did in the beginning
Its not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singing Its something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone the sun comes up
Your still clinging to that notion Every thing is slowing down
River of no return
Recognize my every sound
There is nothing new to learn You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mines a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed my bed my bed I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did Now its not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right
Everything is slowing down
River of no return
You recognize my every sound
There's nothing new to learn You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed my bed my ba ba dee dee bed When you walk in the bar
And you dressed like a star
Rockin' your f me pumps
And the men notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to 'Cause you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that's you whole claim to fame
Never miss a night
'Cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller You're more than a fan
Lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night-stands
He could be your whole life
If you got past one night
But that part never goes right In the morning you're vexed
He's onto the next
And you didn't even get no taste
Don't be too upset
If they call you a skank
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
Or them big baller
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller You can't sit down right
'Cause you jeans are too tight
And your lucky its ladies night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers So you did Miami
'Cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody
And spent the night getting cane Without girls like you
There'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you
There's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives Don't be mad at me
'Cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps Brother
There's so much that I could never say to your face
Bye bye now
You should know the world and all its ways so find your place How do I find words that do not condescend
When she bore you before me
'Cause she doesn't need a child she needs a friend
not a sob story 
And your priority it must be heard
Now you must have never heard of what she did for you
'Cause we'll never be the way we were She can't always be there just to hold you down
Our mother
When you are at a age now well life turns around
My brother Realize that you don't have to answer to no man
Responsibility comes down to you
But how can I expect you to understand
When you live life like its so run through 
Your priority it must be heard
Now you must have never heard of what she did for you
'Cause we'll never be the way we were 
And your priority it must be heard
'Cause we'll never be the way we were The way we were we'll never be
And your priority it must be heard Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone to love
Don't go to strangers darling come to me Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers darling come to me For when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all for I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go So
Make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers darling come to me Whoa oh
Oh whoa oh He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on but no one's home
She's so vacant
Her soul is taken
He thinks What's she running from? Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her it never dies So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never dies Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro Red uh huh 
And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes yeah 
And although my pride is not easy to disturb yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this with you next to me 
And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this no no I observe yeah I don't chase
But now I'm stuck with consequences thrust in my face yeah
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be Although my pride yeah is not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans yeah and your Beasties tee yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this no with you next to me yeah yeah 
His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind yeah
Oh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth when it came would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such
But I never hated myself for my age so much yeah And although my pride's 
yeah not easy to disturbed yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb yeah
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this no with you next to me yeah And although my pride's 
yeah not easy to disturbed yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this no with you next to me To know know know him

Need to get my thoughts down but it's getting late
Need to get up now get my feet on the ground
But the show is so unprepared now My place so messed up I tried on some shoes
Should think clear and focus but I've things to do
Glancing at my CD rack eyes linger on Frank
And I must put that check in the bank Try to put me in a room distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I will finally burn
Tempted to work Always got something to do someone to be seeing
Somewhere to be dancing I'm a wake human being
It's an opportunity shout till you go blue
Unless I wanna do it your words go through Need to buy some cigarettes can't put it off any longer
Worked appeal depression I feel it growing stronger
Maybe when I'm all grown up I will get it through
But right now I got stuff to do Try to put me in a room distraction less
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
Tempted to work Put me in a room distraction less
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
Tempted to work Gotta get this song down before I leave tonight
But my hair just does it's own thing and I gotta look alright
And I gotta write a chorus but words allude me now
I have to get this down before I leave somehow And anyway I be thinkin' to meet you at the station
Guilty 'cause I should be home damn procrastination
So when they ask me later I won't tell them how it's going
But now my head is empty and the work load keeps on growing Try to put me in a room distraction less
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
Tempted to work Put me in a room distraction less
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
Tempted to work Distraction less
Spare me from worse
I would finally burn
Tempted to work When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
There must have been but I don't care
I feel the way your soul does there Darling they empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you you're so frustrated
Above we all become what we once hated
Be slight nobody can be that wise I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone yeah
You can get so much from me
I can't help you if you won't help yourself You've got the degree in philosophy
So you think you're cleverer than me
But I'm not just some drama queen
'Cause it's where you're at not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
To hold your head above the sea
And carry you even though you're bigger
'Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure And anyway we're still so young
And this isn't yet the day I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone yeah
I can't help you if you won't help yourself You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years oh most of the time
And I'm I'm just a child and you're full grown
And no I'm nothing like I've ever known yeah
You are like nothing that I ever knew I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you 
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you 
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
We were alone and I was singing this song for you Understand once he was a family man
So surely I would never ever go through it first hand
Emulate all the shit my mother hated
I can't help but demostrate my Freudian fate
My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself it fails to die
And animal agression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got I want it all It's bricked up in my head it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? It's bricked up in my head it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? Aye aye aye aye aye aye
Tell you baby you huggin' up the big monkey man
Aye aye aye aye aye aye
Tell you baby you huggin' up the big monkey man I never saw you I only heard of you
Huggin' up the big monkey man
I never saw you I only heard of you
Huggin' up the big monkey man It's your lie it's your lie
Huggin' up the big monkey man
It's your lie it's your lie
Huggin' up the big monkey man Now I know that now I understand
Huggin' up the big monkey man
Now I know that now I understand
I never saw you I only heard of you
It's your lie it's your lie
Huggin' up the big monkey man There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No sweeter song no heart so true There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing sing to me You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone There is no greater love
In all the world it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for
He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow Put it in writing
But who you writing for?
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done
Reciting my stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
I'll battle till this bitter finale
Just me my dignity and this guitar case whoa whoa If if my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dying for?
B I would have died too
I'd have liked to
If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
If my man was fighting I couldn't resist him
His eyes were like yours
His hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall but I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down You are everything ' he means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came What do you expect?
You left me here alone; I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact ' I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely How can I put it so you understand?
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you; I guess he looked like you
No he wasn't you
But you can still trust me this ain't infidelity
It's not cheating; you were on my mind Yes he looked like you
But I heard love is blind Tonight you're mine completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco where everyone was in jeans
But you were just a rich girl and only having fun
Your worn out dresses got stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl where did you go wrong? You left for London when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom for a date unknown But you were just a rich girl hardly having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl where did you go wrong? Hey little rich girl you've been away for so long
And now little rich girl I wrote this song
Hey little rich girl my love for you is gone
And now little rich girl I know where you belong At your dad's office party all the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache because the screen star was you
You left for London when you were nineteen
Had to pull off your nice clothes but you were living on dreams 
You were a rich girl and only having fun
But your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey little rich girl where did you go wrong? Your neighbors were screaming
I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers hoping he would be there
And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there
And I don' wanted to stay but I got nothing to say You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say'man that was ugly The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box put it in the box
Just take it
Take the box Take the box I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me'you know me
Feel so fucking angry don't want to be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you Mr False Pretence you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry where's my kiss goodbye'
I think I love you The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box put it in the box
Now take it
Take the box
Just take it take it
Take the box
And now just take the box
Take the box Oh lullaby by birdland that's what i
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland could there be words to reveal
In a phrase how i feel Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flying high in birdland high in the sky up above
All because we're in love Lullaby lullaby Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flying high in birdland high in the sky up above
All because we're in love I should care I should go around weeping
I should care I should go without sleeping
Strangely enough I sleep well
'cept for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep So I should care I should let it upset me
I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do (brief instrumental interlude) I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do And I do I would die before I divorce you
I'd take a thousand thumps for my love
'Cause you kiss a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove
'Cause anyone who will see us
Through our victory and done defeat
Knows that I'll take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats Between the cheats
Between the cheats ooh oh oh ooh oh oh My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And he still make this housewife blush
So I'm holding my hand in his
I'm sitting on the royal flush
Women drink him in swimming in his green eyes
Then go home and catch the chips you got
And take a bad beat to ooh to boat oh!
The jack of hearts is my jackpot Between the cheats ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Catch me on have to ?
And I know as my heart beats
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn between the cheats Between the cheats 
Between the cheats ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Swing back and forth
A beautiful thing taking you away
My head is spinning My girl tried to stop me
But I had a taste of you
Unfamiliar surroundings
Left me wanting something new Physical ain't even my type
But you're one of a kind
So subconsciously on purpose
I left my coat behind I can't help it need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah it's nice to meet you too I hate my alcoholic logic
As I write this on the train
Victoria's Secret in my bag
And my thighs ache again Last night tips into my mind
Through the puddle in my head
I always get what I want
I think I even said I can't help it need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah it's nice to meet you too Although I enjoyed it
I should have tied up my loose ends
But I left my jacket with you
And you know my friends So maybe you will get my number
Or ask them when I'm ached down
But I may have forgotten you
By the next time I'm in town I can't help it need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah it's nice to meet you too Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Did you have to go to jail
Put your house up for sale did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
And are you shopping anywhere
Changed the color of your hair are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
You were dodging all the time are you still dizzy? 'Cause since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me

Mm mm Cupid. When you walk in the bar
And you dressed like a star
Rockin' your F me pumps. And the men notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to. Cause you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that's you whole claim to fame. Never miss a night
Cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballers wife.
You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller. You're more than a fan
Lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-nights-stands. He could be your whole life
If you got past one night
But that part never goes right. In the morning you're vexed
He's onto the next
And you didn't even get no taste. Don't be too upset
If they call you a skank
Cause like the news everyday you get pressed. You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. Or them big ballers
Don't do nothing for ya.
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller You can't sit down right
Cause you jeans are too tight
And your lucky its ladies night. With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers. So you did Miami
Cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane. You did too much E
Met somebody
And spent the night getting caned. Without girls like you
There'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone. Without girls like you
There's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives. Don't be mad at me
Cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work. You should have known from the job
That you always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps You're wondering now what to do now you know this is the end
You're wondering how you will pay for the way you misbehaved First time I swallowed 
now you're on your own
I won't return forever you will wait You're wondering now what to do 
now you know this is the end First time I swallowed now you're on your own
I won't return forever you will wait You're wondering now what to do
now you know this is the end
You're wondering how you will pay for the way you misbehaved You're wondering now 
what to do now you know this is the end
You're wondering how you will pay for the way you misbehaved
You're wondering now what to do now you know this is the end
You're wondering how you will pay for the way you misbehaved Simple sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Time to think it through
Consider the change Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
'Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with uplift Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
Some kind of laid back feeling
Oh just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say Why did you do it with him today?
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Sweet reunion Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
Yeah ya know that I'm no good Got back together with my man last night
But I think I was dreaming he didn't feel quite right
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how Do me good I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good do me good do me good do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good do me good do me good do me good It's like he was designed with me in mind
He's so good from behind he's beautifully defined
I miss him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing or feel his shifting weight I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how Do me good I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good do me good do me good do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good do me good do me good do me good I never wanted you to be my man
I just wanted to see what you could do yeah yeah yeah yeah
I feel it my heart like you were there
I never wanted you many times when I tried to set you right it's just too hard
I never wanted you to be my man 
but I really couldn't control myself I can't wait to get away from you
And surprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends...right? You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you're home at night
But we're best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up forget
Everything that happened in between Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends right? I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up forget
Everything that happened in between So I had love for you when I was four
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla so you get the dro
Cause we are best friends right right right right?
Because we are best friends right?
Because we are best friends right? My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longin'
And wondering why it's me you're I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul
I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
And less I could have one more chance to prove dear My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I would gladly surrender myself to you body and soul Attracts me till it hurts to concentrate
Distract me stop me doin work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair. 
Although I've been here before
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculin you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Wheres my morel parallel It takes me half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness from the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track
Although I've been here before
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Wheres my morel parallel His own style right down to his diesel jeans
Imobile I can't think by any means
Underwhere peeks at the top
I'll let you know where you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you
Although I've been here before
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Wheres my morel parallel Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off I fantasize Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Wheres my morel parallel
Although I've been here before
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Wheres my morel parallel Nobody stands in between me and my man it's me and Mr Jones
What kind of fuckery is this? You made me Mr Slick Ricky
I thought I didn't love you when I did
I can't believe you played me out like that No you ain't worth guest lists 
plus one of all them girls you kissed
You can't keep lying to yourself like this
I can't believe you played yourself like this Who loves one thing but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones
What kind of fuckery are we? Nowadays you don't mean dick to me
I might let you make it up to me who's playing Saturday What kind of fuckery are you? 
Besides from some of you being my best black Joe
But I could swear that we were through
I still wonder about the things you do Mr Destiny lying infinitely 
nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones I can see you ahead of me
But I'm not always forward thinkin'
I tell you what you want to hear
It depends on what I've been drinkin' Cause everything I do or say
Makes it hard for you to stay
We both know what it is Now-a-days we talk too much
Like your forgetting all the good shit
You decide what's wrong with me
I always used to let you say But now I like to think out loud
Your runnin' with some different crowd
We both know what it is I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I cant even cry Mr Ultra sensitive
I'll never let myself forget you
Messed each other up you know
So I'm sorry if I upset you Tomorrow is another day
So I'll call you cause that's OK We both know what it is I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And you're attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired
I can't even cry Relationship doesn't remain
We resonate on different flames
I could cut you down again
If you were like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend but my friend I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I cant even cry I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I can't even cry All I can ever be to you
Is a darkness that we knew
And this regret I had to get accustomed to
Once it was so right
When we were at our high
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away I have no capacity He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in this grey in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own I don't understand
Why do I stress a man
When there's so many better things at hand
We could a never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you
A perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon I shouldn't play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And it's okay
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above
A blaze He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And it's okay
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
And as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
So we are history
The shadow covers me
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And it's okay
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And it's okay
My deep shade
My tears dry on their own He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And it's okay
My deep shade
My tears dry She sits home and dreams
That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress she has the flowers planned
Now she won't be happy
Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
But she will be waiting years for her wedding 
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told He won't change her life
He just chasing tail
And wasting her time
She calls herself his wife
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
It's not a good fit
So next time that they row She throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit  So take the gold you find
And for your own sake
Hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
Yes it's fools gold Every day I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school Mister Magic take a token
Mister Magic of my love
Mister Magic I see you through the smoke Without you I'm misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
Yeah 'cause you come naturally Mister Magic take a token
Mister Magic of my love love love (
I see you through the smoke Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through Mister Magic take a token
Mister Magic of my love
Mister Magic I see you through the smoke Mister Magic
Mister Magic waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear It's always gone within two days.
Follow my father his extravagant ways.
So if I got it I will spend it all
Camden and Parkway 'til I hit a wall. I cross my fingers at the cash machine
As I check my balance I kiss the screen.
I love it when it says I got the means
To go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans.
Never lasts me long
Handle finance wrong
Blow it all on bags and shoes
Jazz 'n blues. Standin' too deep at the bar today
Wait with impatience to throw my cash away.
Four white Russians a JD and Coke Buy their drinks all night and now I am broke.
But that's cool 'cause I can borrow more from you
And I didn't forget about that fifty pound too.
Tell you what my advance is comin' through
I'll take you out shoppin'
Can you wait 'til next June? Yeah.
Never lasts me long
Handle finance wrong 
Blow it all on bags and shoes
Jazz 'n blues.
Never lasts me long
Handle finance wrong
Blow it all on bags and shoes
Jazz 'n blues. Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each man she passes
Goes Aaah! When she moves it's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes
Each man she passes
Goes Aaah! Oh but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
He would just give his heart gladly But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
He smiles
But she doesn't see
No she doesn't see
Layin' me out to rest
Knowin' when that is
I wake up and de-stress
And I'm diggin' myself into a hole
And these days I just work
I will when I have so much sun CHORUS:
And lately I've forgotten who I am
Late - ely my energy's just drained away
And now..my mind..is workin' overtime
It's been a loooong day
Such a long day
and while all my contempt
I should take in college now
My education is dragging dragging
innit
My guitar to London town
And the thing that wakes me
when I could sleep instead
Is the thought that to deny?
That I could fall back into bed Chorus:
And lately I 've forgotten who I am
Late all my energy's just drained away
And now my mind is workin' overtime
It's been a long day
It's been a long day Recently my head
It ain't recharged as such
And sleep can only cure yeah
A restless mind so much Chorus:
Lately I've forgotten who I am
Sleep too late
My energy's just drained away
And now my mind is workin' overtime
It's been a long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long day
So long so long so long Mmm yeah
Oooooh yeah
boy be my baby
My one and only baby
B boy be my baby
My one and only baby It was winnin' time you know what they say
Did you think about us did you miss your baby?
I'ma catch the train guess I'm headin' your way
You're my number one that's all a newborn son
Won't you be my king? 'Cause I know you care I'll dirty dance for you
And when I'm done I'm gonna do it again
And when it's over I'ma pull you closer
Keep your Nikes on you know how we do
There's nothing he won't try
We're like two stars in the sky You are my rainy day sunshine
It's plain to see
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please  Put two in the air if you feel like me
Someone who cares feels so freaky
In demand by all the ladies
He's not for sale he's being home-delivered to me
So hang up for your trying cards please Love-sick calls that's what I get
I hear his voice and things get wet
Knows what I want then he'll fetch
He's my boo and I'm his little pet his little pet
You never know what he'll do next he's my baby My rainy days my sunshine
Living fantasy
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please Make a name for myself in different ways
All the while you will see my songs of praise
How can I concentrate when all the while my head
Throw me scenarios so I tease my self esteem
Though I can talk it through
Really I finally talk
My frustration is released but nothing let em know
And added to that Im sick of having to seek some peace
Because I need emotion with my physical release Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing I just keep wasting my breath Now everywhere I got and I always stare
I justify attraction by your hands your lips your hair
And so although I always look I know that I cant touch
And because I can only take a full time man so much
And now I reached a point where I dont care anymore
Its a necessity just like it was before
Many says I ignore the way my body aches
Cause Im the shit I earn I cant look for my sins
Oh oh no Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
I cant help but bring it up no
I cant help no no
But my words are for nothing I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing Im wasting my breath
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
But my words are for nothing I just keep wasting my breath You're just a little boy underneath that hat
You need your nerve to hide your ego don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy no I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then My girl says I'm too sensitive to ride with you
But I'm not listening to her mm hm
Yes I'm perceptive so when I've dance with you
You'll whisk your head back the way it were
As you were I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then Oh I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to what you say you're all about yeah I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and them
I gotta know you now and then I gotta know you now
We may never meet again I gotta know you now
We may never meet again You should be stronger than me
You been here 7 years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man
Not pal in comparison to who you think I am You always wanna talk it through - I don't care!
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do - stroke my hair! 'cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady but you my lady boy You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
Always wanna talk it through- I'm ok
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do - are you gay? I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady but you my lady boy He said 'the respect I made you earn -
Thought you had so many lessons to learn'
I said 'You don't know what love is - get a grip!' -
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna rip your body over mine
So tell me why you think that's a crime I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady but you my lady boy Today my bird flew away
Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of bird land every night
Sung for my Ava every night Ava was the morning now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise With dread I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird my beautiful bird
Spoken 'til one day she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing Ava was the morning now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise It begins to tell 'round midnight
'Round midnight
I do pretty well 'til after sundown
Suppertime I'm feeling sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight Memories always start 'round midnight
'Round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And old midnight knows it too When some quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darling I need you
Lately I find
You're out of my arms
And I'm out of my mind Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around He can only hold her for so long the lights are on but no one's home
She's so vacant her soul is taken
He thinks 'What's she running from?
Now how can he have a heart? When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her for what's inside her never dies Even if she's contenting his wants 
she is played with urgency
Searches the man she misses the man that he longs to be
Now how can he have her heart? When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her 'cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her 
'cause of what's inside her it never dies
So he tries to pacify her for what's inside her never dies Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say What did you do with him today?
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Ayo I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperature's so hot the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again cause of old boy
But oh boy together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh what a wet wee-wee
But you played me so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame how you can't get me off the brain
He that lame you love how I bring the pain
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name that's right I'm high post
Get the champagne love word up we gon' toast I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yet you know that I'm no good Attracts me till it hurts to concentrate
Distract me stop me doin work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair.

Wheres my morel parallel I can't wait to get away from you
Unsurprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends right? You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you?re home at night
But we're best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up forget
Everything that happened in between Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends right? I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up forget
Everything that happened in between So I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla so you get the dro
'Cause we are best friends right right right right?
Because we are best friends right?
Because we are best friends right? It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it's happened to you
Nobody knows where my johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine Play all my records keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'Till johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile Judy and johnny just walked through that door
Like a queen with her king
Oh what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes yeah And although my pride is not easy to disturb yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this with you next to me And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to thisno no I observe I don't chase
So now I'm stuck with consequences thrust in my face
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be And although my pride's not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this with you next to me yeah yeah His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind
It serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth when it came would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you get my number down as such
But I never hated myself for my age so much yeah And although my pride's yeah not easily disturbed yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this no with you next to me And although my pride's yeah not easily disturbed yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this no with you next to me

Uuh uh oh oh
Don't know what I would do
Thought of me being replaced
Brings tears right to my face
And I can't think of anybody who would take your place
No I don't wanna leave you I'm no good alone
So I'm staying with you till you want me to go Girl you don't understand what you do to me
Got crazy in my head I don't think I can leave
I need you here with me all night
Girl I can't live without your smile
I'm in love I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
I'm in love I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
I'm in love I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
I'm I'm in love I can't picture you out of my life
Said I can't no I can't
Out of my life
I can't picture you out of my life
Said I can't no I can't
Out of my life Girl you don't understand what you do to me
Got crazy in my head I don't think I can leave
I need you here with me all night
Girl I can't live without your smile

I'm in love I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
I'm in love I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
I'm I'm in love Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh even in the midst of doubt Life is worth living
Life is worth living so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh even in the midst of doubt Life is worth living
Life is worth living so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me Life is worth living
Life is worth living so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again Just a fraction of your love
Fills the air
And I fall in love with you
All over again woo woo woo
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here whoa I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl without you I'm lost
Can't face this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
Oh oh oh oh
Common denominator
Oh yeah woa Before you're love was low
Playing girls was my high
We chase the game that would put
My cot in the side aye
When broken hearts rise up to say
Love is a lie
You and I would stand to be love's reply Out of all things in life that I could fear yeah
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here

So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting 'Cause life's not easy I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you

I'll show you I've got to learn things learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like no matter what they say Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting 'Cause life's not easy I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure

But there's one thing that I know for sure I'll show you
I'll show you Lately I've been thinkingthinking about what we had
And I know it was hard it was all that we knewyeah! 
Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
'Cause nothing can ever ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do yeah! You know there's no one I can relate to
I know we won't find a love that's so true There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you for me together I gave you everything babe
Well everything I had to give
Girl why would you push me away? Lost in confusion like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day But that is the past now we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone be someone be someone You got a fast car
We go cruising entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone be someone be someone You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone be someone be someone You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?

And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
We're just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we'll cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth

And I pray I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
Its in the papers its on the TV
Its everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home But I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Can you tell me how I can make a change I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray I lose my appetite
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner
'Cause half my dinner is still there on my plate
Ooh I got a vision to make a difference
And its starting today 'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Heaven tell me how I can make a change I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and
Pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need
I pray
Can you give 'em one today
I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell how to make a change? I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and I pray I pray
I pray
I pray
I close my eyes and pray Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while What's gonna make you fall in love

You can't fly unless you let yourself fall Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
'Cause I know that a piece of you's gone
Every time he done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song
I figure out What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You don't have to be scared at all oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall I will catch you if you fall

Waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me safe and warm I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas Pacing down the hallway
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pin drop
'Cept for the clock on the wall
And I'm scared you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me safe and warm I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas I'm praying that you make it home tonight
So we can lay down by the fireside
You and I till Christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year
More than just to have you here whoa
I'll be waiting I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me

Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it See growing up I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
'Cause I I just didn't think I wasn't good enough
And maybe if I was good at something that that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because because people aren't perfect and
By not being perfect you you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God it's like He's perfect and He never disappoints
So I I just get my recognition from Him
And give Him recognition Yeah yeah yeah yeah I won't let the night stand in my way yeah
I know what I want I know what I get yeah

By my side But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you've done me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to get along And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you

I would have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me Well now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around
Now you're not welcome anymore Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die? Oh not I

As Long as I know how to love I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive I will survive
It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart I'm trying hard to mend the pieces
Of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me
With somebody new I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you
And so you thought you'd just drop by
And you expect me to be free But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone whose lovin' me

I've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give

I will survive
Yeah yeah
Oh no I want a girl with a mind like a diamond
I want a girl who knows what's best
I want a girl with shoes that cut
And eyes that burn like cigarettes I want a girl with the right allocations
Who's fast thorough and sharp as a tack
She's playing with her jewelry
She's putting up her hair
She's touring the facilities
And picking up slack
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket. I want a girl who gets up early
I want a girl who stays up late
I want a girl with uninterrupted prosperity
Who uses a machete to cut through red tape With fingernails that shine like justice
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass
She is fast thorough and sharp as a tack
She's touring the facilities and picking up slack
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long long jacket I want a girl with a smooth liquidation
I want a girl with good dividends
At City Bank we will meet accidentally
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen She wants a car with a cup holder armrest
She wants a car that will get her there
She's changing her name
From Kitty to Karen
She's trading her MG for a white Chrysler LeBaron
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket Reluctantly crouched at the starting line
Engines pumping and thumping in time
The green light flashes the flags go up
Churning and burning they yearn for the cup
They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank
Reckless and wild they pour through the turns
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern As they speed through the finish the flags go down
The fans get up and they get out of town
The arena is empty except for one man
Still driving and striving as fast as he can
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns He's going the distance
He's going for speed
She's all alone 
All alone in her time of need Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
He's going the distance
No trophy no flowers no flashbulbs no wine
He's haunted by something he cannot define
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
Assail him impale him with monster-truck force
In his mind he's still driving still making the grade She's hoping in time that her memories will fade
'Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's striving and driving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns 'Cause he's going the distance
He's going for speed
She's all alone (all alone)
All alone in her time of need Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
He's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse He's going the distance
He's going for speed
He's going the distance Ah no so sad alright
Oh no oh no no no Okay all right oh no
This one this one this one Heads of state who ride and wrangle
Who look at your face from more than one angle
Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpened knives through chicken McNuggets Now heads of state who ride and wrangle
Who look at your face from more than one angle
Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpened knives through chicken McNugget

When I've got you next to me It's been a long time
Since we tripped into this ditch
It's been a long time
Since we drank the arsenic It's been a long time
Since we've been inside of this tomb
It's been a long time
Since you wore your expensive French perfume
But I don't mind 
No I don't
But I don't
When I've got you next to me It's been a long time
Since I've seen your smiling face
It's been a long time
Since I've seen a sunny day You won't admit you love me
And so how am I ever to know?
You only tell me
Perhaps perhaps perhaps A million times I ask you
And then I ask you over again
You only answer
Perhaps perhaps perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted broken hearted So if you really love me say yes
But if you don't dear confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps perhaps perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted broken hearted So if you really love me say yes
But if you don't dear confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps perhaps perhaps Perhaps perhaps perhaps
Perhaps perhaps perhaps I need your arms around me
I need to feel your touch
I need your understanding
I need your love so much You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you
Baby you're never there On the phone
long long distance
always through such strong resistance
First you say you're to busy
I wonder if you even miss me Never there
You're never there
You're never ever ever ever there A golden bird that flies away
A candle's fickle flame
To think I held you yesterday
Your love was just a game You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you
Baby Take the time to get to know me
If you want me why can't you just show me
Well always on this roller coaster
If you want me why can't you get closer Never there
You're never there
You're never ever ever ever there
You're never ever ever ever there Ok

I don't want to
I don't want to Too much carbon monoxide for me to bare
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bare
Where's the air?
Where's the air? Car after bus after car after truck
After this my lungs will be so fucked up
I wish I was in that Mercedes Benz
Sealed away from my sins
I'd have the music high going ninety five Too much
(Too much) Too much carbon monoxide for me to bare
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bare
Don't you care?
Don't you care? Car after bus after car after truck
After this my lungs will be so fucked up
I wish I wasn't just a pedestrian breathing all this in
I look up at that grey sky
It makes me want to Too much
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bare I don't want to wonder if this is a blunder
I don't want to worry whether we're going to stay together till we die

All the dishes rattle in the cupboards when the elephants arrive I want to love you madly
I want to love you now
I want to love you madly
I want to love you love you love you madly I don't want to fake it I just want to make it
The ornaments look pretty but they're pulling down the branches of the tree
I don't want to think about it I don't want to talk about
When I kiss your lips I want to sink down to the bottom of the sea I want to love you madly
I want to love you now
I want to love you madly
I want to love you love you love you madly I don't want to hold back I don't want to slip down

I want to love you now
I want to love you madly
I want to love you love you love you madly I'm not feeling alright today
I'm not feeling that great
I'm not catching on fire today
Love has started to fade
I'm not going to smile today
I'm not gonna laugh
You're out living it up today

The stonemason does all the work
The barber can give you a haircut
The carpenter can take you out to lunch Now I just want to play on my panpipes
I just want to drink me some wine

So you might as well have a good time Sheep go to heaven

That haunts dismembered constellations
A faintly glimmering radio station
While Frank Sinatra sings Stormy Weather
The flies and spiders get along together
Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record Beyond the suns that guard this roost
Beyond your flowers of flaming truth
Beyond your latest ad campaigns
An old man sits collecting stamps
In a room all filled with Chinese lamps He saves what others throw away
He says that he'll be rich someday
We know of an ancient radiation
That haunts dismembered constellations
A faintly glimmering radio station
We know of an ancient radiation
That haunts dismembered constellations
A faintly glimmering radio station While Frank Sinatra sings Stormy Weather
The flies and spiders get along together
Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record I had a match
But she had a lighter
I had a flame
But she had a fire
I was bright
But she was much brighter
I was high
But she was the sky Oh baby
I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby
I was bound to let you go I don't know much about Cinco de Mayo
I'm never sure what it's all about
But I say I want you
And you don't believe me
You say you want me
But I've got my doubts Oh baby
I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby
I was bound to let you go I had a match
But she had a lighter
I had a flame
But she had a fire
I was bright
But she was much brighter
I was high
But she was the sky Oh baby
I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby
I was bound to let you go (All right) When she walks
She swings her arms
Instead of her hips
When she talks she moves her mouth
Instead of her lips And I've waited for her for so long
I have waited for her for so long
I've wondered if I could hang on
I wonder if I could hang on Let me go she said
Let me go she said
Let me go and I will want you more
Let me go let me go
Let me go and I will want you When she wants she wants the sun
Instead of the moon
When she sees she sees the stars
Inside of her room And I've waited for her for so long
I have waited for her for so long
I've wondered if I could hang on
I wonder if I could hang on Let me go she said
Let me go she said
Let me go and I will want you more

Mahna mahna Two three four People you love
Will turn their backs on you
You'll lose your hair your teeth
Your knife will fall out of its sheath
But you still don't like to leave
Before the end of the movie People you hate
Will get their hooks into you
They'll pull you down you'll frown
They'll tie you and drag you through town
But you still don't like to leave
Before the end of the movie
No you still don't like to leave
Before the end of the show People you hate
Will get their hooks into you
They'll pull you down you'll frown
They'll tar you and drag you through town
But you still don't like to leave
Before the end of the movie
No you still don't like to leave
Before the end of the show Adjectives on the typewriter
He moves his words like a prize fighter
The frenzied pace of the mind inside the cell 
The man on the street might just as well be
The man on the street might just as well
The man on the street might just as well be Outside outside the world
Out there you don't hear the echos and calls
But the steel eye
Tight jaw
Say it all
Say it all But the white paint
Plastic saints
Say somebody
Has got to say it all
Somebody
Has got to say it all I'm so nervous
I'm so tense
My heart can't forget about this self defense
The air is so hot
And my breath comes fast
I thumb the cool blade but I know this can't last I
 thumb the cool blade but I know this can't last Outside outside the world

He moves his words like a prize fighter
The frenzied pace of the mind inside the cell The man on the street might just as well be
The man on the street might just as well
The man on the street might just as well be Launching loony thoughts into the bending of your mind
You reach for something high but it's a mountain that you find
He's a king dust demon with an icepick smile
His music fills your feathers as you feel your passions fly With the mustache man on the carpet of his van
You can feel your fatty tissues giving way to sweaty hands
And the woofers keep distorting and the tweeters kiss the girls
His horn-rimmed glasses lights a square beneath his curls I have wasted so much time
I have wasted so much time He is like a politician who is practicing a speech
He is racing he is pacing he is sleeping on his beat
As the sky begins to darken and the waves begin to roll
You can feel the oceans rising as you're losing all control And meanwhile back at the Candlerock Lounge
It is past 11:30 and your friends are getting down
They're applying purple eyeshadow drinking warm beer
They're wondering where you went to when you told them you'd be here I have wasted so much time
I have wasted so much time I have wasted so much time
I have wasted so much time
You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town It wasn't me that started this whole crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
Yes it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh Ruby I still need some company It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age Ruby I realize
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I'm not around
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town She's leaving now 'cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town
Oh Ruby for God sakes turn around No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone no phone
Ringing stinging Jerking like a nervous bird
Rattling up against his cage
Calls to me throughout the day
See the feathers fly No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone No phone
No phone no phone I just want to be alone today Rhyming chiming got me working all the time
Gives me such a worried mind
Now I don't want to seem unkind
But god No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone no phone
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone no phone Shaking quaking
Waking me when I'm asleep
Never lets me go too deep
Summons me with just one beep
The price we pay is steep
I've been on fire
And yet I've still stayed frozen
So deep in the night
My smooth contemplations will always be broken
My deepest concerns will stay buried and unspoken 
No I don't have any change but here's a few subway tokens
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone No phone I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you I want to fly away
I want to fly away I'm so sick of work
so sick of play
I don't need another day I'm so sick of work
so sick of play
I don't need another day I need to fly away
I need to fly away Every shiny toy
That at first brings you joy
Will always start to cloy and annoy Every camera every phone
All the music that you own
Won't change the fact you're all alone (All alone!) Every piece of land
every city that you plan
will crumble into tiny grains of sand Every thing you find that at first gives you shine
always turns into the same old crime (Same old crime!) I want to fly away
I want to fly away
I need to fly away
I need to fly away (I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you)
(I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you) Every little dance
Every hidden back romance
All alone (All alone!) In a wooden boat in the shipping lanes
With the freighters towering over me
I can hear the jets flying overhead
Making lines across the darkening sky And when the sun is going down I can take a taxi into town
And the waiter at the restaurant sets a table just for one
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round 
So I had a plane to take me to a place so far away from you
Eventually we began to see that we could be completely free
And I could get away from you
And you could get away from me
And we could live each separately in our cities in the sun
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round In a CD karaoke bar
By the banks of the mighty Bosphorus
Is a Japanese man in a business suit singing Smoke Gets In Your Eyes
And the muscular cyborg German dudes dance with sexy French Canadians
While the overweight Americans wear their patriotic jumpsuits 
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round
(Spinning round) Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round
(Spinning round) (I don't know)
Why you say you are not in love with me
(I don't know)
Why you say you are not in love with me
(I don't know) It's coming down
It's coming down
It's raining outside
You've nowhere to hide She's asking you why you think it's funny
It's coming down
It's coming down
She's leaving your house She had to get out
She's mad and she'll take her mattress with her
It's coming down
You lie on the floor She's slamming your door
She's gone and she's wearing your red sweater
It's coming down
It's coming down It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down Well your CD collection looks shiny and costly.
How much did you pay for your bad Moto Guzzi?
And how much did you spend on your black leather jacket?
Is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket? 
Now tickets to concerts and drinking at clubs
Sometimes for music that you haven't even heard of.
And how much did you pay for your rock'n'roll t shirt
That proves you were there That you heard of them first?
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?
How much did you pay for the chunk of his guitar
The one he ruthlessly smashed at the end of the show?
And how much will he pay for a brand new guitar 
One which he'll ruthlessly smash at the end of another show?
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones?
As long as their soda cans are red white and blue ones.
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones? 
As long as their soda cans are red white and blue ones.
Aging black leather and hospital bills
Tattoo removal and dozens of pills.

You're drinking what they're selling.
Your self-destruction doesn't hurt them.
Your chaos won't convert them. They're so happy to rebuild it.
You'll never really kill it.
Yeah excess ain't rebellion.
You're drinking what they're selling. Excess ain't rebellion.
You're drinking what they're selling. Man is born man lives and man dies

What are teenagers doing today?
They're trying every thrill there is in the books.
We got color TV.
But it is still isn't satisfying. Man is born man lives and man dies
And it's all vanity. You can't understand it
It's going so loud and so forth
And they're a-wigglin' and a-wobblin' around
And everything else
And and and yet they're not satisfied
And and these disc jockeys
They hear the tune that is different. Man is born man lives and man dies

for the words
I am wishing you would say to me
I am really only praying that
The words you'll soon be saying
Might betray The way you feel about me
But to me
Coming from you
Friend is a four letter word I've got wheels of polished steel
I've tires that grab the road
I've got seats that selflessly hold my friends
And a trunk that can carry the heaviest of loads 
I've got a mind that can steal me to your house
And a heart that can bring you red flowers
My intentions are good and earnest and true
But under my hood is internal combustion power
And Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is the only one who seems to understand I've got brakes I'm wide awake
I can stop this car at any time
At the very last second I can change directions
Turn completely around if I feel so inclined I've got a mind that can steal me to your house
And a heart that can bring you red flowers
My intentions are good and earnest and true
But under my hood is internal combustion power
And Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is the only one who seems to understand
Satan is my motor When you tried to kiss me
I only bit your tongue.
When you tried to get me together
I only came undone.
When you tried to tell me
The one for me was you
I was in your mattress back in 1982. Daria I won't be soothed.
Daria I won't be soothed over like
Smoothed over like milk
Silk a bedspread or a quilt
Icing on a cake
Or a serene translucent lake.
Daria Daria Daria
I won't be soothed.
I won't be soothed. When you tried to tell me
Of all the love you had
I was cleaning oil from beaches
Seeing only what was bad.
When you tried to feed me
I only shut my mouth.
Food got on your apron
And you told me to get out. Daria I won't be soothed.

Dances in a fever at the castle rock
Dust-devil cypress and ripening fruit
Ascending quick into the author's bathroom Fawn Jo and Tootsie are out on a wire
Lettuce-toothed junkies all full of desire Meanwhile Rick James takes her nude
And there's nothing I can do
Meanwhile Rick James takes her nude And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can say to you
I've got a lot of work to do
I guess I'll leave it up to you Uninvited we'll stay if we want
Searching through your closets for your grandfather's gun
We will swim in your kidney kidney-shaped pool
Scratching at the bottom for another clue yeah Fawn Jo and Tootsie are out on a wire
Lettuce-toothed junkies all full of desire Meanwhile Rick James takes her nude
And there's nothing I can do

And they're trying to get through
There's no single explanation
There's no central destination But this long line of cars
Is trying to get through
And this long line of cars
Is all because of you
You don't wonder where we're going
Or remember where we've been
We've got to keep this traffic
Flowing and accept a little spin So this long line of cars
Will never have an end
And this long line of cars
Keeps coming around the bend
From the streets of sacramento
To the freeways of L.A.
We've got to keep this fire burning
And accept a little gray
So this long line of cars
Is trying to break free
And this long line of cars
Is all because of me This long line of cars
Long line of cars
Long line of cars
Long line of cars She's writing she's writing she's writing a novel
She's writing she's weaving conceiving a plot
It quickens it thickens you can't put it down now
It takes you it shakes you it makes you lose your thought
But you're caught in your own glory
You are believing your own stories
Writing your own headlines
Ignoring your own deadlines
But now you've gotta' write them all again. You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you
You want her confront her just open your window
Unbolt it unlock it unfasten your latch
You want it confront it just open your window
All you really have to do is ask
But you're caught in your own glory
You are believing your own stories
Timing your contractions
Inventing small contraptions
That will roll across your parlor's hardwood floors [Chorus[
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you 
I am an opera singer
i stand on painted tape
It tells me where I'm going
And where to throw my cape
I call my co-stars brother
I call my co-stars name
I play both good and evil parts
I sing to Verdi's grave And every single morning
By 10 a.m I'm dressed
My rehearsals last for hours and hours
With diligence I have been blessed
Some people they call me monster
Some people they call me saint
My talent feeds my darker side
Yet no-one will complain I am an opera singer
I sing in foreign lands
I've sung for Kings in Europe
And Emperors in Japan And after each performance
People stand around and wait
Just to tell me that they loved my voice
Just to tell me that I'm great
I am an opera singer
I will sing when you're all dead
I sing the mountains crumbling apart
I sing what can't be said Heads of state who ride and wrangle
Who look at your face from more than one angle
Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpened knives through chicken Mc Nuggets Now heads of state who ride and wrangle
Who look at your face from more than one angle
Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpened knives through chicken Mc Nuggets Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers
Will eat your children and steal your thunder
While heavy torsos that heave and hurl
Who crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers
Will eat your children and steal your thunder
While heavy torsos that heave and hurl
Who crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up Now simple feet that flicker like fire
And burn like candles in smoky spires
Do more to turn my joy to sadness
Than somber thoughts of burning planets Now clever feet that flicker like fire
And burn like candles in smoky spires
Do more to turn my joy to sadness
Than somber thoughts of burning planets Your pentagram is down below our floor.
Your naked body shimmers in the night.
Dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.
Your feet are dry with the ashes from dead babies
Who have passed the test just like all the rest
But never really understood the reasons why
They took it in the first place.
Ah in the first place.
Your feisty eyes won't make me fall apart.
Your turquoise and silver won't weaken this old heart.
Yeah dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.
I fell to the ground on a windy windy night.
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest
But never really understood the reasons why
I took it in the first place.
Ah in the first place.
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest
But never really understood the reasons why
I took it in the first place.
Ah in the first place. In the brown shag carpet of a cheap motel
In the dark and dusty corner by the TV shelf
Is a small reminder of a simpler time
When a crumpled up pair of trousers cost a brand new dime Well you ask me how I made it through?
And how my mint condition could belong to you?
When I'm on the ground I roll through town
I'm a president you don't remember getting kicked around I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine I'm freshly minted
I am determined not to be dented
By a car or by a plane or anything not yet invented I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine In the hiss and rumble of the freeway sounds
As the afternoon commuters drive their cars around
There's a ringle jingle near the underpass
There's a sparkle near the fast food garbage and roadside trash I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine I'm freshly minted
I'm silver plated I'm underrated
You won't even pick me up
Because I'm not enough for a local phone call I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine
And I shine I don't want to hear you whisper
I don't want to orbit your world of two There's only room for you
In your world of two I don't like to hang around you
I don't want to live in your world of two There's only room for you
In your world of two It's not that I don't like you
But it's not that I don't love you
It's not that I don't think you are
Two of the most
Perfectly
Beautiful
People in your world In your world of two
There's only room for you
In your world of two
There's only room for you
In your world of two
In your world of two
There's only room

There's only room
For you Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd float down to the sea Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd say just what you please
Without the sticky little kitten
Your ticket could never be free Without the tight little denim
Your virtues would all go unknown
Without the room that you live in
Your cancer would eat to the bone Your muscles would bulge underground
Your demons would all be around
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd burn all these dying leaves Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd lift this steaming herd
You would kill all the sick ones
You would bury them deep in the earth Without the tight little denim
Your virtues would all go unknown
Without the room that you live in
Your cancers would eat to the bone Your muscles would bulge underground
Your demons would all be around
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me Stickshifts and safetybelts
Bucket seats have all got to go
When we're driving in the car
It makes my baby seem so far I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat But when we're driving in my Malibu
It?s easy to get right next to you
I say Baby scoot over please
And then she's right there next to me I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat Alright
Well a lot of good cars are Japanese
Yeah but when we're driving far I need my baby
I need my baby next to me Well stickshifts and safetybelts
Bucket seats have all got to go
When we're driving in the car
It makes my baby seem so far I need you here with me

People just getting lazy complaining Arco Arena
Arco Arena She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
They laugh they make money
He's got a gold watch
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts
that bounce on his Italian leather sofa.
She doesn't care whether or not he's a good man
She doesn't care just as long as she still has her friends
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
they laugh they make money
He's got a gold watch
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa
She's got a serrated edge
that she moves back and forth
It's such a simple machine she doesn't have to use force
When she gets what she wants
she puts the rest on a tray in a ziplock bag
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in

Like she'd done one hundred times before.
Jolene smoothed her dark hair in the mirror.
She folded the towel carefully and put it back in place. Yeah I want to pull you down into bed.
I want to cast your face in lead.
Well every time I pull you close
Push my face into your hair Cream rinse and tobacco smoke
That sickly scent is always always there.
Jolene heard her father's uneven snores.
Right then she knew there must be something more. Jolene heard the singing in the forest.
She opened the door quietly and stepped into the night.
Yeah I want to throw you out into space.
I want to do whatever it takes takes takes. You keep pushing me away
In spite of what you say
I found out yesterday that I've
Been wasting all my time Trying to make you smile
Trying to make this seem worthwhile
You've been pushing me around
In spite of what I do
Trying to make things good for you Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away You've been racing through my mind
You're picking up in speed
You're driving recklessly
It's like a car crash happening on my street Broken bodies at my feet
And sirens on the way They're too late
'Cause nobody's going to save us
We're a rubbernecker's dream
We're burning gasoline Go
Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away And go
Go ahead and destroy this
Better come with an army
Are you feeling feeling okay baby? Uh huh
Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away Cool blue reason empties on the page
Your colleagues are in prison and your enemies in reign
Cool blue reason comes into your world
There's two more dead in Texas and it's probably your girls
Cool blue reason wraps around your throat
The minutes change like seasons
Only eight more hours to go Cool blue reason comes into your life
There's one more dead in Kansas and it's probably your wife
Cool blue reason I'm just talking to myself
Cool blue reason I'm just rearranging Hell
I'm just talking to myself
I'm just talking to myself Cool blue reason wraps around your throat
The minutes change likes seasons
Only eight more hours to go
Only eight more hours left to go Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh lord yeah! Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight
They leave that role to the poor
Time will tell them they have power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating like people just like pawns in chess
Wait until that judgment day comes
Now in darkness world stops turning
As you hear the bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
And as god has struck the hour
They have judgment
God is calling
On their knees the war pigs crawling
Making mercies for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Oh lord yeah! A mirror image of a silver sky
nests of pines and brandy wines build this country to the sky
Do you remember now the oblivion of youthful minds
caught up in the fashions of their time...
Roll away
I can see that clearly now every time I look into this
mirror image of a silver sky
nests of pines and brandy wine build this country to the sky
What would they say?
God is here in this country by the sky
A mirror image of a silver sky
nests of pines and brandy wines build this country to the sky
Piecemeal of yesteryear
a stained glass moment marking time
with full intent on my 22 year old mind
Roll away
I can see that clearly now
every time I look into this mirror image of a silver sky
nests of pines and brandy wine build this country to the sky
What would they say?
God is here in this country by the sky The winter's chill chilled me to the bone this year
And something in my mind just got away
Being in the places where we used to be
Somehow being there without you's not the same. Parking lots office parks and shopping malls
And all you left were bills you hadn't paid.
The winter's chill chilled me to the bone this year
And something in my mind just got away It's all behind you now
You're moving on.
They'll never find you now
You're moving on on on.
Nah nah nah nah nah nah naa
Nah nah nah nah nah nah naa Alcohol cigarettes and luxury goods
Christmas lights look desperate in this room.
Winter's light left me in the dark last night
And Jingle Bells are smothered in this gloom. Winter's trees freezing in the bitter wind
And autumn's leaves have all been blown away.
Being in the places where we used to be
Somehow being there without you's not the same. It's all behind you now
You're moving on.
They'll never find you now
You're moving on on on.
Nah nah nah nah nah nah naa
Nah nah nah nah nah nah naa It's all behind you now
You're moving on.
They'll never find you now
You're moving on on on.

Could someday beat as one
But then the third heart came along
And now our love is gone
I count the many times I've said
I love no one but you
But don't be fooled by
Counting dreams that never will come true Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by every time a heart breaks
The answer only tells us that it's too late
Subtract one love and multiply the heartache Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by every time a heart breaks
The answer only tells us that it's too late
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches Who draws the crowd who plays so loud?
Baby it's the guitar man
Who's gonna steal the show you know?
Baby it's the guitar man He can make you love
He can make you cry
He will break you down
An' he will get you high And something keeps him going
Miles and miles away
To find another place to play And night after night who treats you right?
Baby it's the guitar man
And who's on the radio you know?
Baby it's the guitar man When he comes to town
And you see his face
And you think you might
Like to take his place Something keeps him drifting
Miles and miles away
Searching for the songs to play Then you listen to the music and you'd like to sing along
And you want to get the meaning out of each and every song
And you find yourself a message and some words to call your own
And take them home
Ohh ho He can make you love
He can get you high
And he will bring you down
He will make you cry Something keeps him moving
But no one seems to know
What it is that makes him go? Then the lights being to flicker and the sound is getting dim
The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin
But he never seems to notice
He's just gotta find another place to play Anyway
You have always got to move
You're always trying to prove that
There is something new in
Everything you do. You are mostly in your car
You always seem so far
No matter where you are
You're thinking of your car And everything you say
Is really just a play
For you to get your way
And I found out yesterday
That no matter what you say
And no matter what you do
That you have got to... You have always got to move
You're racing just to prove that
There is something new
In everything you do. You are mostly on the phone
You say you're coming home
You say you're all alone
But I know you're not alone. And everything you say
Is really just a play
For you to get your way
And I found out yesterday
That no matter what you say
And no matter what you do
That you have got to move. You have always got to move
You're racing just to prove that
There is something new in
Everything you do. Repeat X3 When the house was standing
You'd never have believed it
When the house was standing
You'd never have believed
The bricks and mortar have all given way
At first they resisted but then they began to sway How can you say forever is at your command?
How can you say the future's in the palm in the palm of your hand? When the house was standing
You'd never have believed it
When the house was standing
You'd never have believed
That gaping hole was once a foundation
Where you stand now were tools in a basement and How can you say forever is at your command?
How can you say the future's in the palm in the palm of your hand? You won't admit you love me
And so how am I ever to know?
You only tell me
Perhaps perhaps perhaps A million times I ask you
And then I ask you over again
You only answer
Perhaps perhaps perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted broken hearted So if you really love me say yes
But if you don't dear confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps perhaps perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted broken hearted So if you really love me say yes
But if you don't dear confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps perhaps perhaps Perhaps perhaps perhaps
Perhaps perhaps perhaps Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching the sun set
I'll never forget
Watching all the reds and oranges slip away
Letting go of yet another dirty day Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun the sun
Watching the sun go down Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching you leave me
Not quite believing
Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching the sun set
I'll never forget Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun go down
Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars

The same ones that I'm drowning in
You lead your casual slaughters
And I'm the one who helps you win
You've got your grand piano You don't even play piano
I'm the one who plays piano
You don't even play piano
You part the waters The same ones that I'm thirsty for
You invite your friends to tea
But when it's me you lock the door
You've got your credit cards And you thank your lucky stars.
But don't forget the ones who foot the bill
You've got your grand piano
And you don't even play piano I can't believe it's true I can't believe that you
Don't want me anymore
You're with him and you don't even know That I've been dying all day long
And singing sad sad songs
And wishing you were gone Ha is this love?
Oh is this love?
Is this love?
Or should I close the door? Yea my eyes are burning in my head
And seeing only red
And wishing you were dead Is this love?
Oh is this love?
Is this love?
Oh no is this love? I don't thing so
Is this love?
Or should I
Or should I should I
Should I close the door?
Should I close the door? Aah I fooled myself
Yea alright okay Is this love? Tell me
Is this love? I don't thing so
Is this love?
Oh no is this love?
Is this love?
Or should I should I
Should I close the door? Up so close I never get to see your face.
Microscope I might as well be out in space.
Up so close I never get to see the view.
Down your throat I'm never sure if it's still you. Up your nose down to your toes.
In your mouth way down south.
Up so close it seems I only think of you.
Up so close I never see the sky so blue. I only wanted to be sure
That what it was was really pure.
I put my face down in the cake.
My feet were flailing in a lake. Up so close I never get to see your face.
Microscope I might as well be out in space.
Up so close I never get to see you.
Microscope I'm never sure if it's still you. The land of race car ya-yas

You need to pull back your shoulders and tighten your butt.
Yeah come Comanche Comanche Comanche commode.
If you want to have cities you've got to build roads.
You need to find some new feathers and buy some new clothes.
Just get rid of the antlers and lighten your load.

Do you think it's all just murky green?
Don't you think that she would realize?
Yeah do you think she has never seen?
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low
When the waves retire to the darkness below
I know I know Ruby sees all.
I know I know Ruby sees.
I can feel the pressure building high.
You should see you're headed for a storm.
Don't you see it building in the sky?
Don't you think it's time to swim to shore?
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low
When the waves retire to the darkness below
I know I know Ruby sees all.
I know I know Ruby sees all.
I know I know Ruby sees. At first I was afraid.
I was petrified.
I kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side.
But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you'd done me wrong.
I grew strong.
I learned how to get along.
And so you're back from outer space.
I just walked in to find you here
Without that look upon your face.
I should have changed my fucking lock.
I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me. Go on now go.
Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I. I will survive.
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive.
I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give.
I will survive.
I will survive. It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart.
I'm trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart.
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself.
I used to cry.
But now I hold my head up high. And you'll see me with somebody new.
I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you.
And so you thought you'd just drop by
And you expect me to be free.
But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone who's lovin' me. Go on now go.
Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I. I will survive.
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive.
I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give.
I will survive.
I will survive. I'm writing a song all about you
A true song as real as my tears
But you've no need to fear it
'Cause no one will hear it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
I'll tell all about how you cheated
I'd like for the whole world to hear
I'd like to get even
With you 'cause you're leavin'
But sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year You should've told me when it all began
You should've told me long ago
Someday I know you're gonna find
Just one mistake is not enough to change my mind What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again And if the doubting faces made you go
It's only mine that matters now
Those looks will soon begin to fade
If you come back and show them all you're not afraid What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again Now that you know how much I understand
You have no reason to be gone
And if you feel at all like me
Just let me know I'll make it like it used to be What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again
What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all (I know it all)
And we can still begin again
What's now is now (now is now) That Italian guy over there
The one with the polyester pinstriped suit
The one with the gray hair and mustache
Must be thinking really loud thoughts
Because he's nodding and squinting and nodding and squinting
And putting down his metal cane
Like he's making a point and it's very important indeed
Yeah he's making a point and it's very important indeed She'll hang the baskets on the walls
Don't you know I've seen it all before She'll hang the baskets on the walls
But I've seen it all before heard the slamming of the door
Come summer come fall
Come winter there'll be baskets on the floor He'll go to buy her turtle wax
But in his mind he won't be coming back She'll hang the baskets on the walls
But I've seen it all before heard the slamming of the door
Come summer come fall
Come winter there'll be baskets on the floor 
But I've seen it all before heard the slamming of the door
Come summer come fall
Come winter there'll be baskets on the floor She'll hang the baskets on the walls
She'll hang the baskets on the walls
She'll hang the baskets on the walls
She'll hang the baskets on the walls Clouds hung hugely and oppressively
Over our busy little cars
Clouds hung hugely and oppressively
We didn't notice we didn't care we didn't notice Driving along in our luxury cars
Down to our pretty city of stars
Down to our pretty city of stars in our eyes
Money in pockets mugs on TV plugs in the sockets You know it would be easy so easy
It would be easy
It would be easy so easy
It would be easy to crash School teachers beggars bankers Congressmen
Stargazers didn't see a thing
Stockbrokers singers dancers architects
(Stars in our eyes)
We didn't notice we didn't care we didn't notice

Then they flap their wings at the last second.
You see birds fall from the window ledge above mine.
Then they flap their wings at the last second.
I can see their dead weight
Just dropping like stones
For small loaves of bread
Past my window all the time.
But unless I get up
Walk across the room
And peer down below
I don't see their last second curves
Toward a horizontal flight.
All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones.
Now due to a construct in my mind
That makes their falling and their flight
Symbolic of my entire existence
It becomes important for me
To get up and see
Their last second curves toward flight.
It's almost as if my life will fall
Unless I see their ascent.

You tear down the bridge
Flimsy as it is
It's business like.
You shake my hand
You break up the band
Flimsy as it is
It's open mike
punk rock
Red white and blue
You twist the knife
Then go home to kiss your wife
A bigger better slice
is what you'd like
You kick the sand
You get the upper hand
You sell it to Japan
It's natural
Punk rock
Red white and blue You turn the screws
It's what you choose to do
You think that I
Must turn them too
You think that I
Must be so satisfied
I stay inside
I wonder why And the cement mixer gets it all ready
One good turn at a time
Then pouring it slowly and steady
You're showing me where I can sign
What I can expect to find
But how you can you say you'll be happy
When you turn the screws You turn the screws
It's what you choose to do
You think that I
Must turn them too
You think that I
Must be so satisfied
I stay inside
I wonder why Excuse Me I Think I've Got A Heartache
From Wheels-EP (iTunes exclusive) They just don't know how lost I feel without you
My teardrops never see the light of day
I laugh and joke and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say... Excuse me I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied Excuse me I think I've got a heartache
And I'd better say goodbye
Before I cry I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow
I live a lie in all I do and say
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say... Excuse me I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied Excuse me I think I've got a heartache
And I'd better say goodbye
Before I cry I'm writing a song all about you

Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year Strangers in the night
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away And ever since that night
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right I'm sitting by the window of your 32nd floor apartment
Waiting for your phone calls all to end
I'm sitting watching wind blow watching time go watching cars go by
I'm waiting for these memories to begin If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it?
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall fall fall? 
Garbage trucks and taxi cabs don't seem like they can reach me here
The clamor of jackhammers seems so faint
Well the way you treat me like the only slightly brings me down a lot
I don't think that I'll ever be the same If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it?
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall fall fall? Keep on keep on doing it
Right on right on doing it

Love is an apple that is so sweet
Love is something that can't be beat love is strange to me Oh
I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
It's all in the heavens can't you see
You can always depend on me
To give you love Love is a flower in my soul
Love is a story that just can't be told 
Can't you feel it burning more and more
Stop and look at the big wheel roll I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
I would give my life for the glory
Just to be able to tell the story About love
I didn't mean to make you mad
A sweet story I thought I had
But maybe time will bring us together And I can be such a happy fella
About love
Love is something that is so divine
Love is a feeling that's a friend of mine (love) It can't be measured by no sign 
In your heart or even in your mind
About love Love is as bright as the morning sun Darling you must know that you are only mine
Not for just right now but all the time
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
Are the only things that you said on the day we met 
This love I try to fight but I couldn't know love too long
And I knew the way that I was I wouldn't be round too long
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
When I think about all the things you said
To help me through my days Now I need you more desperately than I ever did
All the things we've done all the things you say
Just drives me outta my head So baby please please won't you stay with me forever?
I want you to stay with me baby yeah

For no love has meant this much to me
In the past couple of years And if you let me there is nothing I wouldn't do for you
And if you trust me with your love
Then I will make your dreams come true So baby please please won't you stay with me forever?

There was a time we could walk the street with some peace of mind
Oh not today
We got to fight the fears that seize us
Make them a believe us
We all in this together
And we all got to take a stand Chorus
We got to leave the guns at home
We can't make in this world alone
We got to leave the guns at home
Knowing we can't win this prize alone The time is right
We all must lead the fight
To answer to somebody
Everything going change
The stake points in this game
We must love one another
(Love one another)

Oh baby
Thinkin' of you
I know you can tell what's on my mind
Oh baby
And I've been feeling this way for such a long time
Ya baby
Make you cry
It's something that just gets down in your bones
I find my way through the five o'clock rush hour
As daylight slowly leaves the sky
I open the door to that little room
That we call home
Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
At the end of the day
You know it's always been that way
And then I find my way through the early morning traffic
But someone else is heavy heavy on my mind
I open the door to our favorite little coffee shop
The girl is right on time now Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there always there to meet me.
And that's how I start my day
It's just too bad it doesn't end that way
One women's making my home
The other girl is making me do wrong
I didn't mean to let it get that strong no baby
I got to decide where I belong.
Sometimes I get so mixed up inside
I wish I could find a place to hide
I didn't mean I didn't mean
I didn't mean to let it get that strong no girl
I got to decide where I belong 
Baby baby baby... Oh baby What's taking you so long?
I've been waiting on the phone
Oh you haven't been home
Where have you gone? What do you know
And where do you go
Oh I love you so
I've been waitin' on you Oh baby let me hear I got over you
You weren't real anyway
Oh why did you say
I love you so Before I learned my A be see
